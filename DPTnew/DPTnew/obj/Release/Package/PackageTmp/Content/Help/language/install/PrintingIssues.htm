<h3>Printing Issues</h3>
<p>When trying to print out some parts of the online documentations, some issues may arise. Here are the work-arounds for such situations.</p>
<ul class="noleft">

<li><a href="#Recursivity">Printing help linked documents is not recursive</a></li>

<li><a href="#images">Printed help articles do not show the images</a></li>

<!-- <li><a href="../install/REDAX.htm"><b>Unexpected link error</b></a></li> -->
<li><a href="#Completeness">Printed help articles are not Complete</a></li>
<li><a href="#include">Printed help article does not look correct</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;"><a name="TS11"></a>Printing help linked documents is not recursive</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Printing of the contextual help is possible, as documented in the relevant article. In the <b>Print</b> dialog box, a check box enables you to <b>Print all linked documents</b>.
<br>
Since the help system structure is made up of links intended for interactive use that enable you to browse back and forth throughout the articles without limitations, in order to avoid the possibility of endless print jobs the <b>Print all linked documents</b> is limited to the first nesting level.<br>
In other words, if you print all documents linked by an article, only those directly linked to the latter will be printed; links present in the linked articles will be ignored.<br>
Finally, please note that if any printed page should not look correct, you can print each of those pages one by one proceeding as described in "<a href="#include">Printed help article does not look correct</a>".</p>

<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;"><a name="images"></a>Printed help articles do not show the images</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Depending on your operating system setup, on some Microsoft Windows configurations you may run into problems trying to print the help articles because the images do not show on paper.
<br>
This issue sometimes occurs when trying to print the article from an Internet browser window, such as the ones opened upon clicking on a link to another subject.
<br>
If this is your case, use the help system searching tools to locate the article that you wish to print, open it in the main help window, and print it by right-clicking in the right frame.</p>
<hr color="silver">

<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;"><a name="Completeness"></a>Printed help articles are not complete</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">When trying to print a document by right-clicking and selecting <b>Print</b> in the context menu, the printed document you actually obtain might be unexpectedly incomplete.
<br>
If this issue &nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;due to the internal structure of the document itself&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;occurs, please print the document again by right-clicking <i>on the very top</i> of the document itself (for instance, close to the heading) and choosing <b>Print</b> in that location. This action will be enough to solve the problem and obtain a complete printed copy of the document.</p>
<hr color="silver">

<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;"><a name="include"></a>Printed help article does not look correct</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Some pages in the online documentation are built at run-time (for example, this is the case of all the pages describing the <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="MenuBar_Document_Tools.msg+MenuBar_Document_Tools+1726">Options/Properties</span> categories).
When you print one of such pages you may encounter one of the following issues:</p>
<ul class="noleft">
<li>Some parts are truncated.</li>
<li>Some images not visible on the screen are printed on the paper.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">A valid work-around to solve this issue is to proceed as described in the following steps:</p>
<ul class="noleft">
<li>Maximize the document using the proper button on the upper right corner of its window.</li>
<li>Resize it once or twice.</li>
<li>Print it again.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">In case the issue should still be there, repeat the above steps once more. The printed copy you obtain should now be correct.</p>
