Join_ContinuityG2C="When the check box is not selected (default), the command will respect the C-continuities only, so even if at a joint there was a higher order of G-continuity than the level of the C-continuity, then the resulting curve at the joint will retain its C-continuity level. On the contrary, when this checkbox is selected, the same curve will not only be C-continuous, but its C-continuity degree will be increased to the one of the former G-continuity."
