to_70_11_OP_41="  When selected, ensures that calculation of the length of an IGES text string accounts for the final space. The length of a text string in IGES does not normally include the space after the final character. If lar  represents the width of every single character, spa  represents the spacing between characters, and n  represents the number of characters, according to IGES specifications the length of a string is:&nbsp; (1)  n                   × lar  + (( n  - 1) × spa )  rather than the value expressed by the simplified formula: (2)  n                   × ( lar  + spa )  which includes the space after the last character. By default, the conversion uses formula (1). However, since many post-processors use formula (2), the resulting strings are longer than the originals. You can account for this situation by selecting this check box."
