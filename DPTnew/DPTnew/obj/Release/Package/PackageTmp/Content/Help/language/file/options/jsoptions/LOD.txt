LOD="The VRML files, both version 1.0 and 2.0, save the level of detail (LOD) information as a native scene graph node. However, some VRML reader utilities are not capable to manage this file format, that is considerably more complex. When this check box is selected, the level of detail is saved in the VRML file. When this check box is cleared, the level of detail is not saved in the VRML file. The later one is the recommended setting for most users of self-made VRML readers."
