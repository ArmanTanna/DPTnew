<p style="margin-bottom:2px;">The <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+700">Planar Bounding-Box</span> command enables you to define a controlled modification using a set of control points lying on a plane of your choice&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;the <i>deformation plane</i>.<br>
 The controlled modification will be propagated orthogonally to it: each point contained in a line perpendicular to the plane will be deformed in the same way.</p>

<ul class="noleft">
<li>First, select the <i>type</i> of entities the command is to be applied to. In the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+114">Entities</span> drop-down list under <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+35">Entities to Be Modified</span> you can choose one or more of: <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+116">Solid</span>, <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+36">Surfaces</span>, <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+37">Curves</span>, or <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+38">Points</span>.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Once the entity type has been set, you can select the entities to be modified. A rectangular grid of five control points along each side will be displayed.<br>
Please note that you can always <i>add</i> further control points to the ones of the initial grid by setting the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCMDCOMMON_LABEL_+60">Mode</span> to <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCMDCOMMON_LABEL_+58">Add control points</span> and by clicking on a line in between two existing control points. This way, a whole row of control points will be added (note that though being in <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCMDCOMMON_LABEL_+58">Add control points</span> mode, if you click on an existing point, rather than in between two, you will be enabled to move the point about).<br>
<br>
<a name="CP"></a>You can also increase or decrease the number of control points by selecting <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+801">Increase Control Points</span> or <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+802">Decrease Control Points</span>, respectively. One new grid of control points is symmetrically added or removed in both directions.<br>

<li>User modifications are preserved when new control points are added.</li>

<li>The deformation plane can be defined in two different ways, by choosing the proper option in the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="SurfaceUI.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+75">Mode</span> drop-down list: 

<ul class="noleft" style="margin-bottom:0;">
<li>Automatically, using the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="SurfaceUI.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+99">On View</span> option: in this case the deformation plane is the view plane.</li>

<li>To define a different deformation plane, select the <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+701">Select plane</span> item. Once you have selected it, you can access the <a href="mk:@MSITStore:help.chm::/language/HWfile/T_HW_PlaneSurface.htm">plane definition items</a>.</li>
</ul>

<br>
</li>

<li>To actually perform and <i>apply</i> the controlled modification, you can use the control points. So, once the deformation plane has been selected, you can set the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCMDCOMMON_LABEL_+60">Mode</span> to <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCMDCOMMON_LABEL_+57">Edit control points</span>, select the control points as desired (about the selection of control points, see "<i><a href="mk:@MSITStore:help.chm::/language/surfaces/HWfile/T_HW_ms_02_08.htm">Edit Control Points</a></i>") and drag them about to the very position corresponding to the controlled modification you want to apply, which you can interactively check.</li>
