btm_unit="The values in the Bend Table Manager are displayed as per the shown unit of measure. It is the same unit of measure that has been set for the current document. This drop-down list is grayed out and hence not selectable. However, if the Bend Table Manager is invoked while no document is open, the drop-down list will be active and the desired display unit can be selected in it."
