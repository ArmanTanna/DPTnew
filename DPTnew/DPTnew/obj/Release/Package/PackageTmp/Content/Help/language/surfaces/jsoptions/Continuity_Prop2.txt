Continuity_Prop2="Enables you to define the propagation factor of the second surface. Propagation factors are values in the range [0,1] controlling the extent to which the change is distributed over the surface. The higher the propagation value, the more the change extends to the rest of the surface, starting from the involved boundary. 0 inhibits propagation, 1 extends the change to the whole surface "
