PartingLine_DensityHL="Enables you to define the density angle of highlight curves. When you decrease the density value highlight curves will be more concentrated around the selected point. When you increase the density value highlight curves will be distributed on a wider area. Density values vary in the range [0-360] (if a bigger value is entered, it is automatically set to 360)."
