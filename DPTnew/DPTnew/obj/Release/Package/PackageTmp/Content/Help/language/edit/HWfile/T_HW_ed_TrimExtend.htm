<H4>Trimming a curve at its virtual intersection with another one</H4>
The <a  href="../FWfile/T_FW_ed_TrimExtend.htm"><b>Trim/Extend Curves</b></a> command can trim two curves also when they are not lying on the same plane (unless they do not intersect in any plane or view direction). When a <i>virtual</i> intersection is detected, a proper message is displayed. Upon confirmation, the trimming operation is performed along the current view direction.
<p>The two curves in the following illustration, for example, clearly have a virtual intersection:

though they are not lying on the same plane:

</p>
<p>To accomplish the following task on your own, load file "TEC.e3", then start the <b>Trim/Extend Curves</b> command.</p>

<td>As soon as you move the cursor onto the second curve, a preview of the result is displayed.

When you click to select the second curve, a message is displayed to warn you a virtual intersection along the current view direction has been detected. Confirm to go on and cut the curve.
