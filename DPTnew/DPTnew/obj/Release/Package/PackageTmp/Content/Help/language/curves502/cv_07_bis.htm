<h4>Significance of Tangent Weights</h4>

<LI>Select the <b><a  href="../curves/FWfile/T_FW_cv_07.htm">Connect Curve</a></b> command.<br>&nbsp;
<LI>Click on the two curves you want to connect.
<BR><br><IMG border=1 src="../curves/images/ConnectW.gif"><br>&nbsp;
<li>In the <b>Edit Mode</b> drop-down list, if not already selected, select <b>Automatic</b>.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the <b>Default</b> drop-down list under <b>More Options</b>, if not already selected, choose <b>Minimum degree</b>.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>If not already so, set the <b>Continuity By</b> to tangency (<b>Tangency</b>) for both endpoints.<br>&nbsp;</li>


<LI>In the <B>1st Weight</B> and <b>2nd Weight</b> mini-dialog boxes, type 1 for the weights of both curves.<br>&nbsp;

<LI>Click <img src="../../images/general/OKbutton.gif" border="0"> to create the following curve.<br>

Since in this case the connecting curve is a cubic spline with a continuity of 2, and 4 control points, the polylines defining them consist of three segments. The first segment is tangent at its start point to the first curve you select and the third segment is tangent at its end point to the second curve you select. The two arcs shown in the following illustration are the same as those in the previous example. Since the weights are both 1, the lengths of the first and third segments are the same (to see the segments, start the <a  href="../tools/to_07/HWfile/T_HW_to_01_07_05.htm"><b>Single Entity</b></a> command and select the <b>Control points</b> check box).
<BR><br><IMG border=1 src="../../images/curves502/cvi05_07.gif">
<br><br>

If the weight of the first curve is 3 and the weight of the second curve is 1, however, the length of the first segment is three times as long as the second segment.
<BR><IMG border=1 src="../../images/curves502/cvi06_07.gif"><P>

Similarly, if the weight of the first curve is 2 and the weight of the second curve is 3, the resulting segments are twice and three times as long as the corresponding segments when the weight of each curve is 1.<br>

Finally, note in the following illustration what happens when a weight of 3 is assigned to both curves.
<BR><br><IMG border=1 src="../../images/curves502/cvi09_07.gif"><br><br>

Therefore, if <I>p<SUB>1</SUB></I> and <I>p<SUB>2</SUB></I> are the weights of the two curves to be connected, <I>l<SUB>1</SUB> </I>the length of the first segment of the definition polyline when <I>p<SUB>1</SUB></I> = 1 and <I>l<SUB>3</SUB></I> the length of the third segment of the definition polyline when <I>p<SUB>2</SUB></I> = 1, then the lengths of the first and third segments of the definition polyline are, respectively: <P><I>l<SUB>1</SUB>' = p<SUB>1 </SUB>x l<SUB>1</SUB></I> <P><I>l<SUB>3 </SUB>' = p<SUB>2 </SUB>x<SUB> </SUB>l<SUB>3</SUB></I><P>

Understanding this relationship is an advantage when creating a curve to connect two existing curves. You can create an initial curve with both weights equal to 1, so that you can inspect the length of the &quot;unit&quot; sections <I>l<SUB>1</SUB> </I> and <I>l<SUB>3</SUB></I>, and then assign new weights to the first and second curve which act as multiples of the unit sections.<P>
