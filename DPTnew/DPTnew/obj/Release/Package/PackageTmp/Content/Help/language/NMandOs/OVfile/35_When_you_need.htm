<h3>When you do need a&nbsp; solid (closed or manifold), when you don't</h3>

<p>What you need to know:</p>
<UL class="noleft">
<LI><A href="35_what_is.htm"><b>What is a solid, what is an open solid</b></A> 
<LI><A href="non-manifold.htm"><b>What is a non-manifold solid</b></A>
</LI></UL>
  
<p>You need a closed solid:</p>
<ul class="noleft">
<LI>When you are otherwise prevented from completing your work (ex: you have to work with solid features in an area in which the solid is "broken", faces are missing (ex. fillet on a disconnected edge: just one surface attached). 
<LI>When an object is supposed to be closed and it is not (may be a problem, maybe not). 
<LI>When you need to use an STL file. 
<LI>When you need to create a cavity subtracting it from another solid. 
</LI></ul>

<p>You don't need a closed solid:</p>
<UL class="noleft">
<LI>When you are not interested in a closed volume, but in a shape, a skin. 
<LI>When you need to join together (not merge)&nbsp; surfaces as if they are a whole shape. 
<LI>When you need to work on surfaces as if they are a solid.
</LI></UL>

<p>In general, when using a non-manifold solid does not prevent you to from accomplish your goals:</p>
