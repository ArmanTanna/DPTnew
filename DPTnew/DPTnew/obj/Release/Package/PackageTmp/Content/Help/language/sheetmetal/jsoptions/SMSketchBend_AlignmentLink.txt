SMSketchBend_AlignmentLink="Enables you to select the alignment for sketched bends; the first three cases refer to the solid after bending, the last one refers to the unbent solid: Inner flange -- the flange is completely internal relative to the profile position; Outer flange -- the flange is external relative to the profile position; Outer flange and bend -- the bend and the flange are external relative to the profile position; Bend line -- determines the position of the bend line in the developed solid. The last option can be used to evaluate the solid after bending, starting from the 2D drawing of the solid development with the bend position."
