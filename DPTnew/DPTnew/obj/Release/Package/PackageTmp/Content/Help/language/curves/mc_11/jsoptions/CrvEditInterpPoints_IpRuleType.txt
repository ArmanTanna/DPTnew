CrvEditInterpPoints_IpRuleType="Enables you to choose 3 to create an ordinary cubic spline, 5 to create a quintic curve or 7 to create a septic curve when you need smoother continuity at the interpolation points.<br>By default the resulting curves are cubic splines. In order to provide smoother continuity at each interpolation point, it is possible to create also quintic and septic curves (degree=5 or 7). This is a great benefit when modifying the curve by editing its control points, as the curvature plots will remain smooth."
