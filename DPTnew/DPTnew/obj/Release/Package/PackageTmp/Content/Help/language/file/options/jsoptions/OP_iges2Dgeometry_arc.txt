OP_iges2Dgeometry_arc="Determines the tolerance value (measured in degrees) used for converting IGES arcs (Circular Arc) with an angle close to 360 degrees. IGES arcs (Circular Arc) with an angle close to 360° within the tolerance value will be converted to think3 arcs with an angle of 360° exactly (circles). All other arcs maintain their original angles as determined in the IGES file."
