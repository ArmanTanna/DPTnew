OP_iges2Dgeometry_act_Z="When selected, ignores the Z-component. Some CAD systems - 2D usually - can assign insignificant values to the Z-component of the transformation associated with the entities. This may cause the conversion of circular and conical arcs into their complementary arcs. Selecting this check-box ensures that the Z-component of the transformation is ignored in the conversion."
