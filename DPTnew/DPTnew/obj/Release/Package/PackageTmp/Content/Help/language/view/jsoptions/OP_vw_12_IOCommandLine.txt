OP_vw_12_IOCommandLine="Provides an area in which you can type commands you want to input to thinkdesign. You can type any thinkdesign command in this area. The command is executed when you press Enter (note that you can use the Backspace and Delete keys to correct any typing errors before pressing Enter). Whenever a command requires point input, you can type the coordinates of the point in the form x y z. Note that the three numeric coordinate points are separated by a space and preceded by a forward slash character. Clicking the down-arrow button on the right of the Command line displays a list of previous keyboard entries. To repeat a command or reuse a coordinate that you previously entered, select it from this list, and then press Enter"
