OP_IgnoreThreads="When selected, results display also interferences involving objects with some colliding threaded faces (i.e. a threaded screw correctly placed in a threaded hole). When not selected, results exclude these interferences. Make sure that significant interferences are not excluded (i.e. a threaded screw placed too deep in a threaded hole, so that the round-head and the base solid are intersected)."
