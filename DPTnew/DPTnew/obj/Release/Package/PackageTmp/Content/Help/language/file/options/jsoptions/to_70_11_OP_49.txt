to_70_11_OP_49="  When selected, ignores the Z-component. Some CAD systems (usually 2D system) can              assign insignificant values to the Z-component of the transformation              associated with the entities. This may cause the conversion of              circular and conical arcs into their complementary arcs. Selecting              this check box ensures that the Z-component of the transformation is              ignored in the conversion."
