to_70_11_OP_6="If you select None, all the trimmed surfaces are loaded as they are. This method is faster but should only be used if you are sure that the input data is correct. If the data may not be correct (for example, due to the source environment), you should select either Fast or Full. When either of these are selected, if the trimming curves are found to be inexact in any way, the trimmed surface is replaced with the entire surface."
