BlendShape_WeightTo="A numeric value, called Weight, is assigned  to each contour to be connected. The higher the weight, the higher the influence of the corresponding contour on the shape of the resulting surface. A handle is also available to change the weight interactively. Type in the weight for the  second contour, or drag the handle to the desired extent."
