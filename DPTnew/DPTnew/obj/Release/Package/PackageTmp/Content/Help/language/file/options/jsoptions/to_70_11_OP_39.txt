to_70_11_OP_39="  Delta in Y Determines the distance to shift the text origin, as a percentage of the character height. Instead of using the bottom-left corner of the text bounding box as the positioning point for text (as per the IGES specification), some post-processors use a slightly larger rectangle. The  and Delta in Y  values enable you to resolve the              resulting text shift."
