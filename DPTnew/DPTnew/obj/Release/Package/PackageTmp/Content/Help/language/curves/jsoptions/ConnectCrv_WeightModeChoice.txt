ConnectCrv_WeightModeChoice="Enables you to select the type of weights to be set: <br><br>Tangent<br>in this case weights specify the lengths<br>of the tangent vectors: the higher the weight, the<br>longer the section of connecting curve that follows<br>the shape of the connected curved starting from<br>the point of connection.<br><br>Second Derivative<br>in this case weights specify<br>the speed of the curvature change (the higher<br>the weight, the speedier the curvature change).<br><br>Third Derivative<br>in this case weights specify<br>the length of the third derivative in the direction<br>of the tangent for the first and the second curve<br>respectively.<br><br>Fourth Derivative<br>in this case weights specify the length of the<br>fourth derivative in the direction of the tangent<br>for the first and the second curve respectively."
