TangentPlane_SameSize="When checked, the size of the lines is the same for both: if you change one, the other will be modified accordingly. When not checked, the length behavior depends on the value of the Same Ratio check box which shows up in that case. If both Same Size and Same Ratio are unchecked, you will get the actual value for the tangent length."
