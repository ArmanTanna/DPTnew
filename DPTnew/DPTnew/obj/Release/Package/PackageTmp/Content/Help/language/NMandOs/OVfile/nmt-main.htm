<h3>Working with non-manifold solids</h3>

<p>Non-manifold solids are a representation of solids that are not "real solids" as real workpieces. They add a lot of power and flexibility in solid modeling. They may be at times a result of a incorrect modeling step, or an unexpected result in turning legacy surfaces into solid.<br>
However, what is really important is to be aware of their behavior, and to take advantage of it as a unique and powerful <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> feature. &nbsp;</p>

You have a non manifold solid for a reason! Regardless of what caused this situation, in many cases&nbsp; you may ignore this problem and go ahead keeping the solid as it is. This is one interesting feature of the <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application. Let's analyze some scenarios:

<ol>
<li>Performing Booleans with open solids</li>
<li>Applying features to a non-manifold object</li>
<li>Creating a 2D drawing from a non-manifold object</li>
</ol>

When dealing with open solids, sometimes it is&nbsp; important to precisely locate the edges in which a solid is open. Let's see how to do that.</li>
