Offset_ModeChoice="Enables you to choose the offset creation method:<br><br>No trim/extension -- the offset of each selected surface will be<br>created separately, so that if you apply it to a set<br>of surfaces the resulting offset may differ from the<br>original shape.<br><br>Automatic trim/extension -- the initial connection between surfaces will<br>be preserved, so that if you apply it to a set of surfaces<br>the resulting offset will resemble the original shape as<br>much as possible."
