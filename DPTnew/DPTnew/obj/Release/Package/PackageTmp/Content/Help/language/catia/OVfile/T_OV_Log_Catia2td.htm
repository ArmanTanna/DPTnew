<h1>Log file (importing from CATIA<sup><font size="-1">&reg;</font></sup>)</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">When you <a href="../FWfile/T_FW_CATIA2td.htm">load a CATIA file</a>, a log file of the conversion is created:</p>

<ul class="noleft" style="margin-top:0;">
<li>in the same directory of the file you opened</li>

<li>with the same name of the file you opened and the ".log" extension.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The log file structure</h3>

<p>The log file for conversion from CATIA<sup><font size="-1">&reg;</font></sup> lists the conversion parameters and information about the entities converted in the process.</p>

<p>In the log file you find:</p>

<ul class="noleft">
<li>Information about the CATIA model creation such as date, time and CATIA release.</li>

<li>The tolerance within which curves are considered identical.</li>

<li>The CATIA entity inventory (type and count).</li>

<li>The tolerance at which each solid is manifold.</li>

<li>The number of 2D entities processed (if any).</li>

<li>The number of not processed entities, if any, both visible and hidden.</li>

<li>The list and count of <img src="../../../images/company/ThinkDesign.gif" align="middle"> entities in the output file.</li>

<li>Warnings, if any.</li>
</ul>
