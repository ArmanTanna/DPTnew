ThreadExtension="Choose the Extension mode: Full -- the resulting thread extends to the whole selected face; Depth -- starting from the initial edge of the hole, the resulting thread extends only to a certain Depth to be typed into the corresponding box; Double -- this can be done in different ways: for example, if you add a thread to a hole or shaft using the specific option of the Simple Hole or Simple Shaft command, you can then add another one using the Thread command. After selecting the first edge, you will have to select a second edge, a new designation type and a hand. As soon as you select the related edge, an additional mini-dialog for the designation selection and a depth interaction element, linked to the curve, shows up in the graphics area. Depending on the type and surface diameter, you could select two different designations compatible with the given value."
