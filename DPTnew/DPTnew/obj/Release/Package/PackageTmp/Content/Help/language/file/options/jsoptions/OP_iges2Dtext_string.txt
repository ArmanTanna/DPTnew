OP_iges2Dtext_string="When selected, ensures that calculation of the length of an IGES text string accounts for the final space. The length of a text string in IGES doesn't normally include the space after the final character. If 'lar' represents the width of every single character, 'spa' the spacing between characters and 'n' the number of characters, according to IGES specifications the length of a string is: n × lar + ((n - 1) × spa) rather than the value expressed by the simplified formula: n × (lar + spa) which includes the space after the last character. By default, the conversion uses the first formula. However, since many post-processors use the second one, the resulting strings are longer than the originals. You can account for this situation by selecting this check-box."
