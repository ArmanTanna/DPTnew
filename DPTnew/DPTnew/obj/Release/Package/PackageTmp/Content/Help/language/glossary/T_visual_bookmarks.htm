<h4>Visual Bookmarks</h4>

In the left pane, you get three tabs: 

<ul>
<li><span id="TWOD">Model/</span>Drawing Structure&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;showing the structure, according to which environment you are in <span id="TWOD">(model/drawing)</span></li>

<li>Visual Bookmarks&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;listing the user's bookmarks <span id="TWOD"></span></li>

<li id="HIDELI">Annotations&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;listing the annotations associated to the model (only for models)</li>

<li>Layers&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp; showing the layer management controls and listing the layers in the opened <span id="TWOD">model/</span>drawing</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><span id="HIDETD"></span></li>

<li>Shared groups&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;listing of shared groups<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Visual Bookmarks <span id="TWOD">in <b>ThinkDesign Engineering</b></span> provide a fast and simple way to save and restore the general status of a document by managing the visual appearance, <span id="TWOD">the feature activation status and the presence or absence of Spreadsheet variables</span>.</p>

<p>When you create a Visual Bookmark, you specify which sets of parameters must be captured, among a wide range including the view data, <span id="TWOD">the render mode, the active layers,</span> the visualization status of entities<span id="TWOD">, annotations and components and the presence or absence of features and Spreadsheet variables</span><span id="HIDETD">etc</span>. All these data are stored into the Visual Bookmark and saved along with the document. You can recall an existing Visual Bookmark any time, so all the parameters it contains are restored and you bring the document back to the status at the time the Visual Bookmark was created.</p>

<p>Some typical applications of Visual Bookmarks are:</p>

<ul>
<li>with 2D drawings</li>

<li id="HIDELI">in design review process</li>

<li id="HIDELI">with assemblies</li>

<li>with drawing views</li>

<li id="HIDELI">together with annotations</li>

<li id="HIDELI">with Sheet Metal parts</li>

<li>in trying different configurations/snapshots</li>

<li>....</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
 

<p><span id="TWOD">Just to have an idea on how you can effectively use Visual Bookmarks, when reviewing a design, you can create, export and import Visual Bookmarks (or a whole <a href="T_category.htm">Category</a> of Visual Bookmarks) that help identifying design issues in a model being reviewed, in assemblies you can create several Visual Bookmarks bringing an assembly to different <i>working situations</i>, while in a Sheet Metal part you may wish to view it at different steps of the manufacturing process, that is keeping some specific features inactive or active.</span></p>

<p><span id="TWOD">Suppose, for example, you are working with an assembly, within your company, and a colleague of yours is working on the same assembly, but on another sub-assembly. You may wish to view just the components involved in the sub-assembly you are working on and define/keep some working parameters enabling you not to interfere with other parts of the same assembly such as viewing close components roughly, that is not in detail. Similarly, the colleague working on another sub-assembly may wish to define/keep some different parameters linked to the same document (viewing just the sub-assembly with its own components in detail, hiding or viewing not in detail not involved parts, working in wireframe mode rather than rendering mode, keep some features not active and so on) for your same operative reasons. Therefore, every person working on the same object can proceed with different operative working parameters, in order to dramatically streamline his/her job. Similarly, you may wish to transfer a model, with some specific Visual Bookmarks associated to it, to a colleague of yours that has now to handle it, in order to make his/her job easier.</span></p>
