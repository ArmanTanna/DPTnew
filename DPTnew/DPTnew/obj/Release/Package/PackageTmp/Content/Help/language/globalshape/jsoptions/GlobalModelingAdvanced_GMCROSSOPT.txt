GlobalModelingAdvanced_GMCROSSOPT="Enables you to define the type of constraint to be applied to virtual vertices: Free -- no constraint is active; Fuzzy -- the portions of the curves included in the balls of the corresponding (one or two) Virtual Vertices should match as much as possible the constraints but without any request of a high accuracy; Strong -- in addition to the Fuzzy behavior, the centers of the ball(s) (one or two) should match the constraints exactly"
