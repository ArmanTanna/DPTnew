FilletSurfaceSpined_Extension_Type="Enables you to select the desired extension for your fillet:<ul><li><b>Disabled</b><br>Creates a blend surface whose length is only as long as the length at which the two selected surfaces actually intersect</li><li><b>Full</b><br>Creates a blend surface whose length extends to the outermost edges of either surface (which ever is longer) at the point where the two surfaces intersect.</li><li><b>Trimmed</b><br>Creates a blend surface whose length at the point where it intersects with the selected surface is extended or trimmed to match the length of the surface at that intersection. If the <b>Automatic cut</b> check box (<b>Construction</b> - <b>Advanced</b> category of the <b>System Options</b>) is selected, the portions of the selected surfaces extending beyond the new blend surface are automatically eliminated.</li></ul>"
