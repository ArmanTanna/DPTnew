CDMStaticCheck_MinDist="Enables to set a minimum distance between the objects so that when their distance is less than this value the objects are considered to be colliding. The minimum distance option is meant to work only with faces in highlight. If the distance is set to values greater than zero, then also faces having a distance value smaller than the minimum distance value will be highlighted and treated like if they were interferring. If you choose to see the interference solid, instead, you will be unable to see anything, since the interference solid is calculated with Boolean operations on the real solids. The interference solid is not created in case there is not a real solid intersection."
