BlendShape_Associative="Enables you to control the associativity of the resulting surfaces: <ul><li>When the box is checked, the resulting entities will be <i>Skins</i>, that is open solids, retaining a link to the entities they derive from, so that if you modify the entities, the solids will be updated accordingly.</li><li>When the box is cleared, the resulting entities will be surfaces not retaining any link to the entites they derive from.</li></ul>If you select non-associative entities (such as non-associative surface borders), a message will be displayed to warn you non-associative entities have been selected and that they will become the root of the structure."
