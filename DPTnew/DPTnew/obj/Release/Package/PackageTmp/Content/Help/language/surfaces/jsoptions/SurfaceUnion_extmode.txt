SurfaceUnion_extmode="Select the autsmooth option: Not enabled -- If the surfaces have no shared boundary they are joined. If they already have a shared boundary they are joined at the shared boundary, which becomes an edge. The shape of the surface is not modified and the resulting surface has a real edge at the shared boundary; Fixed boundary -- The surfaces are joined in such a way that the shared boundary is maintained but the shape of the two surfaces is modified to obtain slope continuity. The resulting surface has an invisible edge at the shared boundary. Movable boundary -- The surfaces are joined in such a way that the border between one surface and the other has a uniform curvature. The resulting surface has an invisible edge at the shared boundary."
