Lofted_Orientation="Enables you to select the type of orientation to be applied to the resulting surface: Constant -- the boundary curve is simply translated along the drive curve; Curve based -- the boundary is moved along the drive curve following its intrinsic reference system; Along Work Plane -- the boundary is moved along the drive curve oriented accordingly to the Work Plane reference system; Surface based -- the boundary is moved according to the surface in such a way that the unit vector of its Y axis is parallel to the normal to the surface at every point on the drive curve"
