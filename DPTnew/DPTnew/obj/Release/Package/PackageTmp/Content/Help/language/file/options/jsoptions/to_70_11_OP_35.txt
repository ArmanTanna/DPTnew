to_70_11_OP_35="  Determines the minimum Gap  value (the minimum distance between characters) to be assigned to converted text strings, when the Ratio Priority  check box is selected. IGES text strings (entity 212, General Note ) are defined by the character height number and the total length of the string, while in think design , the length of the text string depends on the Gap and Ratio parameters. Starting from the IGES text length and the number of characters, the converter calculates the Gap value which allows the text in think design  to the same              length as the source text. In some special cases, the Gap calculated              may be too small, or even a negative value. This control enables you              to solve this problem by setting a minimum Gap value."
