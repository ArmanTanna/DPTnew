LinearSweepSrf_Transition="Define how to manage transitions where the set of base curves is convex: Tangent -- to create a cylindrical filling surface; Sharp -- to create a sharp edge by simply extending the two concurrent surfaces; Curvature miter -- to create an edge keeping only curvature continuity with both concurrent surfaces; Tangency miter -- to create an edge keeping only tangency continuity with both concurrent surfaces; Flat -- to create a flat filling surface."
