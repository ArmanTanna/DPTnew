In the <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_TDSWEEP_LABEL_+35">Motion Mode</span> drop-down list  you can choose the method to be used to perform the sweep along the drive:
<table style="margin-Top:0;">
<tr valign="top">
<td><span class="UI_COMMAND" id="TDSweep.msg+_TDSWEEP_LABEL_+32">Constant axis</span>:</td>
<td>The contours will be swept along the drive while keeping the axis constant through out the motion. From the <a href="../../../features/HWfile/T_HW_PointDefinition.htm"><span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_TDSWEEP_LABEL_+36">Direction</span></a> drop-down list you can select the axis direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_TDSWEEP_LABEL_+33">Surface based</span>:</td>
<td>The solid will be swept along the drive curve keeping an orientation based on a selected surface. In this case you need to select the edge of the surface as the driving curve for the <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_SOLID_UI_LABEL_+14">Spine</span> selector. 
</td>

<tr valign="top">

<td><a href="mk:@MSITStore:help.chm::/language/MathConc/T_MC_RuledSurface.htm">Ruled surfaces</a> are obtained by joining the <b>U</b> points of equal value on two base curves with a suitable set of straight lines. In simple terms it is also defined as the set of points swept by a moving straight line. In this case the <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_SOLID_UI_LABEL_+14">Spine</span> selector does not get display in the selection list. </td>

<p>Additionally, a shelled solid can be created by specifying the thickness in the respective <b>Thickness</b> edit boxes of the profiles in the Graphics Area displayed on clicking the <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCOMMAND_LABEL_+5">More Options</span> node. The solid can be made of variable thickness when there are two boundaries. When there are more than two boundaries, we can make solid of non-variable (uniform) thickness only.</p>

<p>The resulting solid is associative to the drive curve and the cross-section profile. If you change any of them, the solid changes accordingly.</p>
