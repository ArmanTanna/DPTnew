PartingPlane_TargetAngle="The angle between the plane tangent to the parting plane along the parting line and the direction of ejection, in the case you need to have a parting plane not exactly perpendicular to direction of ejection. When the parting plane is computed, an optimization is performed on it: the program tries to keep as close as possible to this value while absorbing tangency discontinuities. Some undulations might turn out in the resulting parting plane. They can be avoided by setting the target angle free "
