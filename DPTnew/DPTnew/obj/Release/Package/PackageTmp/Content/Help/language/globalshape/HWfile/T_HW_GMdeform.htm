<h3>Applying a controlled modification to a simple shape</h3>
<p>In this job you will apply a controlled modification to the shape of a surface so that it will be joined to another one, setting continuity conditions along the borders. At the same time, continuity between the original surface and a third surface will be preserved. Proceed as follows.

You will fill the gap between the violet and the blue surface, in order to apply continuity along the common borders. Continuity between the violet and the white surface will be preserved.<p></p></td>

<td class=noteme bordercolor="#ffffe1"><b>Suggestion about selection</b>
<br>In some situations, to make selection easier, it can be useful to select the entities to be modified <i>after</i> the entities to match and/or to preserve. This way, selection is much quicker, as nothing is highlighted in the model. On the contrary, especially in complex models, if you first select the entities to be modified, recognizing and selecting the entities to match and/or to preserve among a number of highlighted entities might not be as easy.

<td class=noteme bordercolor="#ffffe1"><b>Keep projection constraint</b>
<br>In a number of situations you may need to modify a solid while keeping the projection onto a certain plane unchanged. For example, you may need to change the shape of a car hood without modifying the car front. A specific option is now available among the <b>Constraints</b>: <b>Keep projection</b>, which enables you to avoid changes along a given direction, to be selected in the <b>Projection direction</b> drop-down list.
