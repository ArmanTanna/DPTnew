Poly2Spline="Nurbs are approximated to splines (degree 3) by using the tolerance contained in the EP_AD_POLY2SPLINE_TOL parameter which can be set in the I/O window (the default value is 0.2). Since the conversion is an approximation, this option can be used in particular cases, such as when the polylines are the result of a fine discretization. It can be used to reduce the size of the resulting think3 document."
