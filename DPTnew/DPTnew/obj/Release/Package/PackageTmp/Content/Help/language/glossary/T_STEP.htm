<h4>STEP Format: Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data</h4>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">
The STEP format (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, the familiar name for ISO 10303) was created in order to provide a representation of product information and all that is necessary to enable product data exchanging: the aim is to have a single and better standard, covering all aspects of the product life cycle in all industries. 
<p>STEP is an alternative to IGES in all CAD/CAM/CAE applications and systems. Its main goals are <i>completeness</i> (both for exchanging and archiving), <i>extensibility</i>, <i>efficiency</i> (reduced file size and needed computer resources), <i>compatibility with other standards</i>, <i>no redundancy</i> (only one way to represent a concept), <i>independency</i> (no hardware and software constraints).
<p>The structure of this International Standard is described in ISO 10303-1. 
<p>The Application Protocols (parts of the International Standard which specify an application interpreted model satisfying the scope and information requirements for a specific application) regarding the conversion to and from <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b>'s format are:
<ul class="noleft">
<li><b>AP203</b>&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;(<i>Configuration-Controlled Design</i>) an application protocol concerning the exchange between application systems of configuration-controlled 3D designs of <i>mechanical parts and assemblies</i>.
<li><b>AP214</b>&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;(<i>Core Data for Automotive Mechanical Design Process</i>) an application protocol concerning the exchange of information between the applications that support the development process of the mechanical aspects of <i>automotive vehicles</i>.
</ul>
