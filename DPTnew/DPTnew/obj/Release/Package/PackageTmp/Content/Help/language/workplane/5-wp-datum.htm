<h3>Work Plane, Sketching Plane and Datum Plane</h3>
<p>In most CAD systems, expecially with pure solid modelers, the user sketches on the active Sketching Plane. <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application has an extended concept of Sketching Plane called Work Plane, but Datum Planes are also used extensively.
<P>The analogy between Sketching Plane and Work Plane is that the XY plane of 
the program's Work Plane coincides with the well known Sketching Plane. 
<P align="center"><IMG border=1 src="images/dwp-01a.gif"> </p><BR>Starting a new model, the 
Work Plane coincides with the absolute reference system which is a sort of center 
point of your infinite, 3D space. We call that position the <i>World Reference 
System</i>. Once you move the Work Plane, your input will be referred to the new 
position of the Work Plane. If you want to work on the World reference system, 
you need to set the Work Plane back to that position. 
<P>A common mistake is to confuse Work Plane and Datum Plane; the Datum 
Plane (see the <a href="mk:@MSITStore:solids.chm::/language/solids/sl_09/fwfile/T_FW_Sl_03_09.htm"><b>Datum Plane</b></a> command)&nbsp; is an "auxiliary plane" that appears in 

the model history.&nbsp; Usually you define a Datum Plane just to define a Plane 
that has to be parametrically controlled by, for instance, the distance from a 
planar face of a solid. 
<P align="center"><IMG border=1 src="images/dwp-01.gif"></p>
<P>Then, if you need to sketch on the Datum Plane, the Work Plane has to be 
placed on the Datum Plane. Since the Datum Plane is controlled by its distance 
from the face of the solid, changing that dimension, the Datum Plane and the 
related Work Plane will be moved as well. <p align="center"><IMG src="images/dwp-02.gif" border=1><br><br><IMG border=1  src="images/dwp-03.gif"></P>
