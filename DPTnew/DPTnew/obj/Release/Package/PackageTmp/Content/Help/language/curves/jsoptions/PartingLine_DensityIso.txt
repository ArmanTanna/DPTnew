PartingLine_DensityIso="Enables you to change the density of isophotes. Density is an angle. When you decrease the density value lines will be more concentrated, while when you increase the density value lines will be distributed on a wider area. Density values vary in the range [0-90] (if a bigger value is entered, it is automatically set to 90)."
