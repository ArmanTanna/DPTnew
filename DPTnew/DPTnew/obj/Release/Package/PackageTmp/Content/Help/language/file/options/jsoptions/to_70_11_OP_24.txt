to_70_11_OP_24="  When selected, allows you to save and re-load the curve or surface error in the IGES 322 entity without losing any information. think design  associates error information to its own geometric entities. This information is used and updated by several algorithms and introduces an approximation range for the data associated to the entity. This information, present in native think design  .e3 files, would otherwise be lost during saving and opening in the different CAD formats. Selecting this check box allows you to save and re-load the curve or surface error in the IGES 322 entity, without losing any information. The box can be deselected if the IGES file only needs to be read by other CAD systems and does not have to be re-read by think design . Deselecting this check box generates more              compact IGES files, since they don't include the additional              information which would not be recognized by other CAD systems."
