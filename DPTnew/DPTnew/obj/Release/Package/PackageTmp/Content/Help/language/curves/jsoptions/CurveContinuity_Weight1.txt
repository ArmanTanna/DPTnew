CurveContinuity_Weight1="Enables you to adjust the tangency factor at the joint (supplying negative values will cause the tangent to get the opposite direction, just like double-clicking on the handle). The higher the weight, the longer the section of the resulting contour that follows the shape of the initial contour starting from the point of connection."
