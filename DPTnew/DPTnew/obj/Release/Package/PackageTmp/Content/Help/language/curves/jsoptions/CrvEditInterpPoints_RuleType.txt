CrvEditInterpPoints_RuleType="Enables you to select the way the tangent vector is to be modified: Natural -- the section of the curve close to the end point has null curvature (it coincides with the tangent to the spline at the end point); Circular -- the section of the curve close to the end point coincides with a circle passing through the three interpolation points nearest the end point; Cubic -- the section of the curve close to the end point has the shape of the cubic curve through the four interpolation points nearest the endpoint"
