<h4>Saving/Renaming reports</h4>

<p>In some circumstances the program displays the following dialog boxes:</p>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD align=left vAlign=top width=110><A href="#Saving"><span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_ASSYREPORT_LABEL_+19">Saving Report</span></A></TD>


      <TD align=left vAlign=top>When you are trying to save a file including <span id="TWOD">components/</SPAN>shared groups which are read-only within the file and 
<span id="TWOD">components/</SPAN>shared groups which are read-only from the file system, in order to list the items that have not been saved and require some specific actions to be saved</TD></TR>

    <TR>
      <TD align=left vAlign=top width=150><A href="#Renaming"><span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_ASSYREPORT_LABEL_+2">Renaming Report</span></A></TD>


      <TD align=left vAlign=top>After renaming/sharing some items in the duplicated name conflicts occurring when you load <span id="TWOD">models/</SPAN>drawings that include 
<span id="TWOD">components/</SPAN>shared groups with the same name and different geometry. In this case the report shows the information of the actions that you have already carried out.</TD></TR>

</td></TR> </TABLE>
</p>

<H5><A name="Saving"></A>
<span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_ASSYREPORT_LABEL_+19">Saving Report</span><hr color="silver"></H5>



<p>
Any time you save a file including <span id="TWOD">components/</SPAN>shared groups which cannot be saved because they are read-only within the file or read-only in the file system, you get the 
<span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_ASSYREPORT_LABEL_+19">Saving Report</span> dialog box, showing the complete information on the items involved, that is names, diagnosis and path.</p>



<p>
This dialog box helps you understand why the items were not saved. You can save the report to a <em>.txt</em> file.</p>

<p>
Thanks to this information, when you close the dialog box, you can act on the different items and carry out the adequate actions in order to save the file.</p>

<p id="HIDEP">
You may handle files including some read-only items in different situations: for instance, when you don't use any vaulting tool such as the <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> vaulting system in your company. Typically, assemblies may include local/X-Reference components which were made read-only within the file, and X-Reference components which were made read-only from the file system.</p>

<p>
After renaming/sharing <span id="TWOD">components/</SPAN>shared groups from the 
<span class="UI_OPTION" id="idd_assy_name_dupl.msg+idd_assy_name_dupl+1">Duplicated Name Resolution</span> dialog box, the 

<span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_ASSYREPORT_LABEL_+2">Renaming Report</span> dialog box may be displayed, showing a report of the action(s) that you've carried out.</p>




<p>
The dialog box is displayed only if the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="idd_preferences.msg+idd_preferences+219">Show renaming report</span> option is selected in the 
<a href="mk:@MSITStore:forcus.chm::/language/options/IDPP_SET_ASSEMBLY.htm">

<span class="UI_OPTION" id="idd_preferences.msg+idd_preferences+2">System Options</span>.</p>


<p>You can close the dialog box and save the report to a <em>.txt</em> file.</p>
