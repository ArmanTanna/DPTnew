Isoparametric_PropagationType="Enables you to propagate the isoparametric curve<br>you are creating to the adjacent surfaces.<br><br>None -- The isoparametric curve will not be propagated to adjacent surfaces.<br><br>Tangent -- An isoparametric curve for each of the adjacent surfaces with<br>tangency continuity (G1) will be created.<br><br>Adjacent -- An isoparametric curve for each of the adjacent surfaces with<br>positional continuity (G0) will be created.The additional curves will follow<br>the direction of the original isoparametric curve, that is if the first curve<br>was an U isoparametric curve, the additional ones may be either U or V curves<br>on their own surfaces, but they will retain the same direction as the first<br>curve.<br><br>By parameter -- An isoparametric curve for each of the adjacent surfaces<br>with positional continuity (G0) will be created, retaining the same type - thus<br>probably not the same direction - as the original isoparametric curve: if it<br>is a U curve, the additional isoparametric curves will be U curves. The same in<br>the case of V curves."
