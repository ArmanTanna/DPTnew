GenericSweep_AutomaticPlaneDirection="If the check box is selected, the plane whose orientation will be used to sweep the section contours along the drives is determined automatically as the mean plane of the drive contour. It will obviously be the plane on which the drive contour lies if the latter is planar.<br>If the check box is cleared, the plane is to be selected using the Plane Normal drop-down list."
