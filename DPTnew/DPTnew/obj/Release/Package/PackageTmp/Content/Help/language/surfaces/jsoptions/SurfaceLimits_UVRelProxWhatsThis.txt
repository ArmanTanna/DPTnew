SurfaceLimits_UVRelProxWhatsThis="This parameter is used to help the program manage the range of space tolerances for a variety of surface sizes. For example if we have the door panel of a car and a surface defining the molding on the door, they have very different sizes. In one case you might be happy closing a gap of 0.1mm automatically on the door, but this 0.1mm might step completely across a feature on the molding. Another example is a closed surface that could have a gap at the close edge of the surfaces. In this case we could be associating 2 points that are close in the range but are on opposite sides of the surface from each other. This tolerance represents the maximum step that can be taken to close the gap on the surface. It is given as a percentage of the parameter domain. "
