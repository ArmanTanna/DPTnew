<H3>Curve Continuity Commands: a comparison</H3>
<P>Two different commands are available to set continuity between curves. See below the main differences, based on which you can select the one better matching your needs.</p>
<p>As a general suggestion, the <b>Curve Continuity</b> command should match the needs of most users. The <b>Advanced Continuity</b> command should address the needs of those advanced users who require better control on the shape of the resulting curve(s).</p>
