SurfaceLimits_ProxRadiusWhatsThis="The program looks for free end points in the chain. If it finds some, then it sorts them into groups based on a Proximity radius. If there are multiple free-ends, the program only considers the ones that are within the radius to be studied further to determine how to close the gap. In the Manual method, you will set a value for this (Proximity value), that you are comfortable with, and allow the system to make the right choice. Typically this will be a small value. Another option is also available (Automatic) which is to allow the system to just make the right choice and find the closest 2 free-end points and close the gap as it wants on a pair wise basis."
