Perpendicular_SameRatio="If checked, when you modify the length of one line, the length of each of the other two is automatically modified in order to maintain the original ratio unchanged. When not checked, each line length can be modified separately and independently of the others. If both Same Size and Same Ratio are unchecked, you will get the actual value for the tangent length."
