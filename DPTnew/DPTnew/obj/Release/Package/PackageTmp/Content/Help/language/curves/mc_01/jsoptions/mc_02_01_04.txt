mc_02_01_04="Determines the distribution of the movement and weight of the farthest selected points from the last point, which will be marked in green; if you don't get any green marker, no 'last point' is defined and the distribution factor will have no effect. Note that there is a 'last point' for each curve: if two curves are selected, there is a 'last point' for each curve which will be the center of the movement from that curve."
