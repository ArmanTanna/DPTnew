SMStepBend_K_Factor="Enables you to specify the k-factor to be used when creating bends. The k-factor controls the positioning of the neutral radius: 0.5 identifies the middle of the thickness, 0 identifies an outwards development, 1 an inwards development. For example, very hard materials have k-factors reasonably about 0.1, while k-factors for metals are about 0.5."
