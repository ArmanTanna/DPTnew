to_70_11_OP_37="  Determines the minimum Ratio  value (the character base-height ratio) to be assigned to converted text strings, when the Gap Priority  box is selected. IGES text strings (entity 212, General Note ) are defined by the character height number and the total length of the string, while in think design , the length of the text string depends on the Gap and Ratio parameters. Starting from the IGES text length and the number of characters, the converter calculates the Ratio value which allows the text in think design  to the same              length as the source text. In some special cases, the Ratio calculated              may be too small, or even a negative. This control enables you to              solve this problem by setting a minimum Ratio value."
