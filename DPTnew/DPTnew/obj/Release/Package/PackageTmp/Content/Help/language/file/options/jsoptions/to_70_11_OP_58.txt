to_70_11_OP_58="Determines how think3 saves STL files of models containing more than one solid: Single file - all the solids are saved in one file; Multiple files - each solid is saved to a separate file. The name of the first file is specified by the user. The program assigns the name to subsequent files by appending _ (underline) character and a unique number to the user-specified file name (for example, file .stl, file _1.stl, file _2.stl, and so on)."
