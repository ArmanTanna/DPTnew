OP_Distance_between_views="Determines the minimum distance between automatic and derived views when they are inserted into a drawing. (Note that if you change the position of a derived view, this minimum distance is maintained if the derived view is Aligned to main , but in that case, the distance is based on the bounding box surrounding the view. In addition, if the size of the model decreases, the views to not move, but if the size of the model increases, the views are moved in order to maintain the minimum distance.)"
