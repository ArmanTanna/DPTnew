<h3>Mechanical and Artistic approaches to 3D</h3>
<P>Usually there are two approaches to the 3D modeling:<br>&nbsp;
<ul class="noleft"> 
<li>Designers who need to create 3D models that have to be (as much as possible) <i>dimension 
driven</i> or commonly called <i>parametric</i> objects. We'll call this kind of approach 
the <i>mechanical</i> approach. 
<li>Designers who don't care about future 
modifications to their models and that simply shape their 3D model in a more 
<i>free-minded</i> way. We'll call this approach the <i>artistic</i> approach.
</ul> 
<p>There's 
not a pure dichotomy between the two methods; actually there are&nbsp; a lot of 
mixed approaches.</p>
<P>The mechanical approach usually coincides with a <i>fully 
constrained</i> approach, which means that the designer has chosen to add all the 
possible constraints either in terms of <a href="mk:@MSITStore:prf.chm::/language/tocpages/T_TOC_Sketcher.htm">Profiles</a>, or 

assemblies and <a href="mk:@MSITStore:as.chm::/language/assembly/OVfile/T_OV_mating.htm">mating constraints</a>.

<p>Mechanical users who want a fully constrained 3D model need also to be 
aware of HOW they are placing the <a href="5-wp-hidden-hist.htm">Work Plane</a>.</FONT> 
<p>On the other hand, in the "artistic" 
approach how and where constraints are placed is not important. 
"Artists" will keep their focus on the design intent, knowing that even in late 
situations, it will be possible to edit and fix constraints. See <a href="5-edit-fix.htm">How to fix a parametric model by reassigning the Work Plane position to profiles</a>.</P>
