OP_iges3Dadv_write_read="When selected, allows you to save and re-load the curve or surface error in the IGES 322 entity without losing any information. This information is present in native .e3 files. You can disable this option if the IGES file only needs to be read by other CAD systems and doesn't have to be re-read by think3. Deselecting this check-box generates more compact IGES files, since they don't include the additional information which would not be recognized by other CAD systems."
