Continuity_Fitting="When this check box is selected the program may try to improve the result by increasing the degree of the surface to be modified. When the box is not selected, continuity is perfect, but the surface could have some very small arc portions along the parametric direction of the involved boundary; this happens when the arc joints of the two surfaces do not correspond exactly"
