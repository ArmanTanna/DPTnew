CurveContinuity_ShapeFactor="Enables you to control the shape of the resulting contour. Vaklues can vary from 0.0 to 1.0. When the value is 0.0 the result will be computed only based on a shape similarity criterion with the initial part of the chain. When the value is set to 1.0, the result will be computed only based on the distance from the initial part of the chain. When the value is set to an intermediate value between 0.0 and 1.0, both the said criteria will be taken into account proportionally to the value itself."
