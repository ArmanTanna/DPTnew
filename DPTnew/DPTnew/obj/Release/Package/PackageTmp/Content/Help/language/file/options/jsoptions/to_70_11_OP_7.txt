to_70_11_OP_7="The options in this area control how the program must handle trimming curves. The IGES format has two different descriptions of the trimming curves of the trimmed surfaces: one relating to the surface, created with isoparametric UV curves and an independent one created with normal three-dimensional curves. You can select one of the two types, or choose to perform conversion using the value indicated as 'preferred' in the IGES file (default)."
