OP_Mode="Enables you to select the constraint detection mode: Simple or Inferred. Choose simple when you apply just one constraint a time. Choose inferred when you want the program to identify more than one constraint a time. In inferred mode, when you click on a suitable reference entity, the program creates the corresponding constraint, then tries to infer additional constraints, which are consistent with the shape of both objects, the one to be positioned and the reference one. For instance, when you mate a cylindrical pin and a blind cylindrical hole, in inferred mode the program will add a coincidence constraint between the two planar faces that are contiguous to the pin and the hole"
