Lofted_ReparameterizeCurves="Enables you to choose the proper parameterization for the base curves, so as to get the best results: <br><br>Intrinsic -- The ordinary curve parameterization. It can be used in most of the ordinary situations, but does not detect sharp points; <br><br>Clean Curves -- If there are invisible sharp points in the base curves, the quality of the resulting surface might be lower than expected.<br>This item enables you to create a nicer surface, as the command will use a local copy of the base curves with no sharp points;<br><br>Curvilinear -- A normalized arc length parameterization type.The curve parameter varies proportionally to the curve arc length, so that <br>arcs with equal length on the curve correspond to equal variations of the curve parameter).<br>Using this option all the input curves are internally re-parameterized based on their arc length and you will generally get surfaces with <br>more regular isoparametric curves.Please note that if the selected curves have invisible sharp points, using this option will also result <br>in creating nicer surfaces as in the case of the Clean Curves option."
