	    <p>Windows does not supply OpenGL accelerated drivers out of the box. End users will need to install drivers from OEM or video hardware manufacturers in order to access native hardware-accelerated OpenGL. These drivers can be found on the web sites of most hardware manufacturers. 
        <br>The two major changes introduced from Windows Vista to OpenGL are the new driver model and the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM), formerly known as Longhorn Display Driver Model (LDDM). The new Desktop Window Manager with its Desktop Composition Engine provides 3D accelerated window composition when Windows Aero is turned on. OpenGL and Direct3D are treated the same by Windows, resulting in full integration into the OS for both API's.</p>
        <br>
		<ol class="myol1">
        <li>Install display drivers from OEMs or video hardware manufacturers in order to access native hardware acceleration.<br>
		<br>
		<li>Once the display driver has been properly installed and configured, run the application and click the <b>Tools &rarr; Options &rarr; System Options &rarr; Graphics &rarr; Graphics card &rarr; Self-tune</b> button.<br>
		<br>
		<li>Disable Windows effects such as animations, transition effects for menus and tooltips, shadows under menu and so on. These options can be disabled from <b>Start &rarr; Control Panel &rarr; Classic View &rarr; System &rarr; Advanced System Settings &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Performance Options &rarr; Visual Effects &rarr;</b> settings.<br>
		<p>For example:</p>
