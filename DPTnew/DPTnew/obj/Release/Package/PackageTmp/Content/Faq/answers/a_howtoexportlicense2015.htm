        <p><span class="hl">Warning</span>: if you have the <span class="hl">right to export</span> your license (see previous FAQ), you can keep reading and export it. On the contrary, please stop now and do not export it, as you will not get one as replacement!<br><br> 
        
        <p><span class="hl">Important Notice</span>: if you have the <span class="hl">right to export</span> your license (see previous FAQ) and you are using version 2015, you will be able soon to 'export/import' licenses by yourself through the <a href="http://dpt3.dptcorporate.com">DPT3 Care</a> (cfr. relevant FAQ).<br><br> 
        <p>From the PC where the license is on, run Sentinel ACC and download the <span class="hl">C2V</span> file.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>

        <br> 
        <br>
        <p>Now you can send an email to <a href="mailto:pwdrelease@think3.eu">pwdrelease@think3.eu</a>, attaching the <span class="hl">C2V</span> file and specifying your company name, your name and surname and your email address. (Alternatively, you can skip the download of the C2V file, by providing with the email the KeyID which corresponds to the license you are exporting).</p>
        <br>
        <p>As soon as possible, you will get from DPT a special <span class="hl">V2C</span> file, which cancels the license(s). Insert it in the <b>Update/Attach</b> of the ACC, download one more time the C2V file and send it again to <a href="mailto:pwdrelease@think3.eu">pwdrelease@think3.eu</a>, in order to confirm that cancelation has taken place.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When this process is over, you can import the license(s) on a new PC. In order to do it, you should generate its C2V file (<a href="../../../Faq/Index#generatec2v" target="_parent">How to generate a C2V file?</a>)</p>
