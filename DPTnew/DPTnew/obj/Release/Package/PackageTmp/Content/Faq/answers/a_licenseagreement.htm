	   	        <p>The use of DPT software is ruled by a <span class="hl">License Agreement</span> which is embedded into our solutions.</p>
        <br>
		<p>This is an abstract from the License Agreement, regarding some definitions:<br><br></p>
        <table width=100%>
             <tr>
              <th width=15%>Business</th>

             <tr>
              <td>PLSS</td>      
              <td><span class="hl">Permanent License Service Subscription (PLSS)</span>: indicates an annual subscription Agreement which entitles the Customer to receive the new product versions or updates together with the Hotline and Web Support Service. Under this Agreement the Producer will provide the customer with the new versions and/or updates of the product, made during the subscription period.
The Customer has also the right to export each license, for one (1) time during the calendar year, from the computer on which such a license was originally installed, to another computer of his/her property.</td>
             <tr>
              <td>ASF</td>      
              <td><span class="hl">Annual Subscription Fee (ASF)</span>: under this subscription agreement, the Customer has the right to use the license of the product for 12 months. When the license expires the product is no longer usable. During the period of validity of the product license, the Customer is entitled to receive the new product versions or updates from the Producer. The ASF subscription includes also the Hotline Assistance and the Maintenance Services for these versions.</td>

              <td>CVU</td>      
              <td><span class="hl">Current Version Upgrade</span>: indicates the agreement under which the Customer re-activates the PLSS subscription starting from a license to Use the Product (PL), and is therefore entitled to all PLSS subscription services.</td>

              <td>CHW</td>

This contract does not provide any update or new version release, which are instead covered by the PLSS subscription.</td>

        <p>Very important for the correct management of 'export of licenses' is what is provided in clause <i>2.2 Installation and Copies</i>. Here is an abstract:</p>
<br>
<div class="letterDiv">
<p>The Customer has the right to use the Product and any subsequent release <span class="hl">only</span> on the computer(s) <span class="hl">originally</span> officially licensed by DPT.<br> (...)<br>
The Customer with a PLSS subscription has the right to export each license covered by such a contract, only one (1) time in a calendar year, from the computer on which the license has been originally installed, to another computer of his/her property.<br>
The Customer with a license to Use the Product (PL), without a PLSS subscription, who wants to exploit the services provided with such a subscription, can re-activate it by signing a Current Version Upgrade (CVU) contract.<br>
The Customer with a license to Use the Product (PL), without a PLSS subscription, who needs to export his/her license from the computer on which it has been originally installed to another computer of his/her property, can subscribe a Change Hardware (CHW) contract. This contract does not provide any updates or new version releases, which are instead covered by the PLSS subscription.
