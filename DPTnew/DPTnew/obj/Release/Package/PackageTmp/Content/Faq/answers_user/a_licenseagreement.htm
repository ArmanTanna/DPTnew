	   	        <p>The use of DPT software is ruled by a <span class="hl">License Agreement</span> which is embedded into our solutions.</p>
        <br>
		<p>This is an abstract from the License Agreement, regarding some definitions:<br><br></p>

        <p>Very important for the correct management of 'export of licenses' is what is provided in clause <i>6. Product Use</i>. Here is an abstract:</p>
<br>
<div class="letterDiv">
<p>The Customer has the right to use the Product and any Product Release <span class="hl">only</span> on the computer <span class="hl">originally</span> indicated to DPT..<br> (...)<br>
The Customer with a PLSS subscription has the right to export each license covered by such a contract, only one (1) time in a calendar year, from the computer on which the license has been originally installed, to another computer of his/her property.<br>
The Customer with a license to Use the Product (PL), without a PLSS subscription, who wants to exploit the services provided with such a subscription, can re-activate it by signing a Current Version Upgrade (CVU) contract.<br>
The Customer with a license to Use the Product (PL), without a PLSS subscription, who needs to export his/her license from the computer on which it has been originally installed to another computer of his/her property, can subscribe a Change Hardware (CHW) contract. This contract does not provide any updates or new version releases, which are instead covered by the PLSS subscription.</p>
