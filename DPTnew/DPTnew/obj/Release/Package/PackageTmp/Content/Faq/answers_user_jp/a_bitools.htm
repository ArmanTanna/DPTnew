	   	<p>This section will host an introduction about some Business Intelligence Tools that DPT will share with VARs. We are talking about special pivot tables, containing all the information about VAR&quot; installed base, in terms of <span class="hl">Customers</span> and <span class="hl">Licenses</span>. Information are organized in a way to support VARs in many activities: forecasts, sales, order processing, sales, campaigns, sales. And - I nearly forgot - sales!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Such very sensitive information will be confidentially shared through the Dropbox channel established with each single VAR. Thus information is always up-to-date.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here is where you can find also your <span class="hl">Help</span> about the use of BI Tools.</p>
