Under this subscription agreement DPT will send to Customer the Software Updates, issued during the Subscription Period. 
			  Customer with a PLSS subscription for a Permanent License (PL) has the right to Export such License once (1 time) during the Subscription Period, from the computer on which such License was originally installed, to another computer of its own.</td>

        <p>Very important for the correct management of 'export of licenses' is what is provided in clause <i>1. DEFINITIONS - Export</i>:</p>
<br>
<div class="letterDiv">
<p>Transfer of a License from the computer on which it is currently enabled to another computer or to the same one if reconfigured, keeping the License unchanged. 
Export is allowed for one (1) time during the Subscription Period and only for Licenses with a PLSS, ASF, or ASP subscription.</p>
