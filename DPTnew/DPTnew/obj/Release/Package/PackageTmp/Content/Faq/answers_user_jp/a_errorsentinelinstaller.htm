	    <p>If, when launching <strong>DPT_Safenet_Sentinel_Installer.exe</strong> (which can be found in the Download area of the Customer Care portal), the following message shows up...</p>
        <br> 
        <img class="centerImage"
        src="../img/Error_Sentinel_Installer.jpg">
        <br>
		<p>...it means that on that very PC the Sentinel service has already been installed previously through the Installer. <br>
		Actually, no comparison is made between the versions of the new Installer and of the already installed one, but the error message is issued even if the new one is more recent.</p>
        <br>
		<p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Uninstall DPT Safenet Sentinel from the Windows Control Panel and install it back again. <br>
		If, on the PC, the Sentinel Service has already been installed previously during ThinkDesign installation or using <strong>haspdinst.exe</strong> from ThinkDesign installation folder, the Installer will work correctly by overwriting the existing driver.</p>
