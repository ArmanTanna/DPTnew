<h3>Why Open Solids are Important</h3>

<p>Open solids are one of the major features of the <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application. Let's see why.</p>

<P>What you need to know:</p>
<ul class="noleft">
<li><A href="35_what_is.htm"><b>What is a solid, what is an open solid</b></A></li>
</ul>

<p>Open solids give us a new hybrid arena to work in within. The <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application gives us powerful tools to manipulate solids, surfaces, and everything in between.</p>

<UL class="noleft">
<LI>You can work on imported parts that are incomplete, even if some surfaces are missing or incorrectly translated. 
<LI>You can turn solids into surfaces and vice versa, retaining associativity (if suitable). 
<LI>You can join several surfaces by means of a single entity (ex. to create a cutting tool). Those surfaces won't be merged together, but just sewn together as a quilt. You can always get back to the original surfaces. 
<LI>You are always allowed to "edit directly" your model, without restrictions. 
<LI>You can modify a "skin" by means of both Solid Features (ex hole, fillet) and Surfacing tools (drag control points, add tangency, GSM, etc.). 
<LI>You can combine the power and engineering control of solid modeling technology with the design flexibility of an advanced surface modeler to provide true organic shape design in a single environment. 
<A href="26_booleans_opensolids.htm">See this simple example</A>.
</LI></UL>

<p>You will never get "stuck" when solid modeling features fail, as they inevitably do. Surfacing technology 
can always take over, and you can finish your design.</p>

<p>A typical,&nbsp; clever example in practice is the Core&amp;Cavity creation in moldmaking process:&nbsp; <A href="26_shape.htm">See this example</A>.</p>
