<h3>Open vs non-manifold</h3>

<p>This article will explain the difference between "non-manifold solids"&nbsp; and "open solids." <BR>We recommend that you first read <A href="Open-Solids.htm">Open Solids</A> and <A 
href="non-manifold.htm">non-manifold solids</A>.</p>

<H4>The difference</H4>
<P><I>Non-Manifold</I> Technology is one of the best characteristic of the 
<b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application. This allows you to apply solid features to objects that are not defined in the real world. Open solids are an example.</p>
 
<P>By reading the Open solids article, it is clear that an open solid is a skin made of adjacent surfaces that behaves like a solid, except for the disconnected edges.</p>

<P>A non-manifold solid occurs when there's at least one edge that does not have 
two (and only two) faces merging with it. This is a&nbsp; more general situation 
than open solids:</p>
<UL class="noleft">
<LI>Open solids are always non-manifold. 
<LI>Non-manifold solids are not always just open solids. In general, they&nbsp; might include a larger number of possible situations.

      surfaces ).</TD></TR></TABLE>
	  
<P>The warning "Non-manifold" that might appear when creating a solid starting from surfaces or that might appear when applying a feature to a manifold object, generally means that topology is not being respected. The most common cases are vertexes with a non-real number of edges on them, or simply cases where a surface is completely or partially overlapped with another. <BR>When making a solid from surfaces, there's a warning that allows you to realize if the solid is just open (and where it is open), or if the solid contains non-manifold 
faces.</p>

<H4>An example</H4>
<P>Let's use the following example:&nbsp; This is a set of legacy surfaces.</p>

<P><IMG height=243 src="../../../images/solids/NMandOS/disconn-nonmainfold-1.gif" width=280 border=0></p> 
<BR>Making a solid with the <a href="../../solids/FWfile/T_FW_Sl_08.htm"><b>Make Solid</b></a> command, you obtain a solid that is "not 

closed", that means non-manifold. You can highlight the disconnected edges. 
<BR><br><IMG border=1 src="../images/NCL03.gif"></p> 
What does this mean? For some reason there must be degenerate edges, that is, edges that 
share more than two solid faces leading to a non-manifold situation. You can 
easily locate these edges (see <A href="locating-open-edges.htm">Locating open 
(disconnected) edges</A>).</p>

<P>For serious cases,&nbsp; all the appropriate surfacing tools are available in 
order to fix the situation by editing the incorrect surfaces (as an example 
trim, untrim, positional continuity and so on). Most of the time, these problems 
come from a low quality translation from other CAD applications, or from 
mistakes in surface modeling (as an example, when you create lots of duplicated, 
inappropriate surfaces then you forget to delete the useless ones). <BR>You can 
search our knowledgebase for real world cases. <BR></P>
