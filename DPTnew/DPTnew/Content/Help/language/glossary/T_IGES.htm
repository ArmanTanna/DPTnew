<h4>IGES Format: Initial Graphics Exchange Specification</h4>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">
The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) is an American national standard defining a neutral format for the exchange of digital information among CAD systems. 
<H5>The IGES Domain</H5>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">
"This Specification establishes information structures to be used for the 
digital representation and communication of product definition data.
<p style="margin-top:3;margin-bottom:0">
The file format defined by this Specification treats the product 
definition as a file of entities. Each entity is represented in an 
application-independent format, to and from which the native 
representation of a specific CAD/CAM system can be mapped. The entity 
representations provided in this Specification include forms common to 
the CAD/CAM systems currently available and forms which support the 
system technologies currently emerging.
<p style="margin-top:3;margin-bottom:0">
In Chapters 3 and 4, the product is described in terms of geometric and 
non-geometric information, with non-geometric information being divided 
into annotation, definition, and organization. The geometry category 
consists of elements such as points, curves, surfaces, and solids that 
model the product. The annotation category consists of those elements 
which are used to clarify or enhance the geometry, including dimensions, 
drafting notation, and text. The definition category identifies groupings 
of elements from geometric, annotation, or property data which are to be 
evaluated and manipulated as single items."

<H5>IGES File Structure Overview</H5>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">
"The fundamental unit of data in the file is the entity. Entities are 
categorized as geometry and non-geometry. Geometry entities represent 
the definition of the physical shape and include points, curves, surfaces, 
solids, and relations which are collections of similarly structured 
entities. Non-geometry entities typically serve to enrich the model by 
providing a viewing perspective in which a planar drawing may be composed 
and by providing annotation and dimensioning appropriate to the drawing. 
Non-geometry entities further serve to provide specific attributes or 
characteristics for individual or groups of entities and to provide 
definitions and instances for groupings of entities. The definitions of 
these groupings may reside in another file. Typical non-geometry entities 
for drawing definition, annotation, and dimensioning are the view, drawing, 
general note, witness line, and leader. Typical non-geometry entities for 
attributes and groupings are the property and associativity entities.
<p style="margin-top:3;margin-bottom:0">
A file consists of 5 ... sections, Start, Global, Directory Entry, 
Parameter Data, and Terminate. A file may include any number of entities 
of any type as required to represent the product definition. Each entity 
occurrence consists of a directory entry and a parameter data entry. The 
directory entry provides an index and includes descriptive attributes 
about the data. The parameter data provides the specific entity definition. 
The directory data are organized in fixed fields and are consistent for all 
entities to provide simple access to frequently used descriptive data. The 
parameter data are entity-specific and are variable in length and format. 
The directory data and parameter data for all entities in the file are 
organized into separate sections, with pointers providing bi-directional 
links between the directory entry and parameter data for each entity. The 
Specification provides for groupings whose definitions will be found in a 
file other than the one in which they are used."
