<H3>Isolating a mating constraint</i></H3>

<p>When working with complex assemblies, there can be situations when you need to check mating constraints for <b>interferences</b>, <b>form and fit</b> etc. The <a  href="../FWfile/T_FW_Isolate.htm"><b>Isolate</b></a> command enables you to view the selected mating constraint discreetly. You can apply this command on mating events at any level of the assembly hierarchy.

<p>Apply the command, on the top level mating constraint of a Kinematic chain assembly.</p>
