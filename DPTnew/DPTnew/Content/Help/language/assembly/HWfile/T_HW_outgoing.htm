<h4>Creating/breaking a component including outgoing references</h4>

When creating a new component:

<p>
<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=top>
<TD><P>If the entities selected have references with other entities not included in the selection, the program asks you how to deal with such outgoing references.</P> 

You get information about the outgoing references that are involved:
<ul>
<li><b>Current</b> &nbsp;&#151;&nbsp; highlights the current entity 
<li><b>Total</b> &nbsp;&#151;&nbsp; states how many entities are involved
</ul>

By selecting <b>Next</b>, the following entity is highlighted. 
<p> 
For each outgoing reference you have the following options: 

<UL>
<LI><B>Keep</B> &#151; enables you to preserve the link created in the modeling phase  
<LI><B>Unlink</B> &#151; enables you to <I>break</I> the link, which will be lost.
</ul>

Select <b>Apply to All</b> to keep/unlink the relation to all the entities.

</p>



</TD>
</TR>

</table>


<p>
<table border=1 bordercolor="navy" bgcolor="#FFFFE1">
<tr>
<td class=noteme bordercolor="#ffffe1">
The same information is applied to an existing component, including outgoing references, that is broken: exactly as during the component creation, when breaking a component you can view the outgoing references that are involved and decide whether any of them/all of them must be kept or not.</td></tr></table>
</p> 


<p>
Please note that when you select an entity with outgoing references which refer to <i>two</i> levels up in the assembly hierarchy, you get a message warning you that the reference cannot be kept because it depends on one or more entities outside the current component.</p>

<p>
<table border=1 bordercolor="navy" bgcolor="#FFFFE1">
<tr>
<td class=noteme bordercolor="#ffffe1">
In other terms, outgoing references are allowed only if they refer just to one level up in the hierarchy.
</td></tr></table><p></p>
