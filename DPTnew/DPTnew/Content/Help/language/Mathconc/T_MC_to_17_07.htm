<h5>Curvature analysis</h5>

The curvature value is the reciprocal of the radius.
<br>
If the radius is constant, the curvature is constant too. In the following picture you can see the 
constant graph of curvature of an arc:<br><br>
<img src="../../images/tools/to_07/toi90117.gif"><br><br>
So, in the example of the picture above, the radius is r=1/0.27=3.7.<br><br>
In the example of the following picture:<br><br>

<img src="../../images/tools/to_07/toi90217.gif"><br><br>
the curve on the left is obtained by an arc by modifying the weight of two of its control points.<br>
The graph of curvature shows a regular curvature:<br>&nbsp;
<ul class="noleft">
<li>if the curvature value is close to zero, this means that part of the curve has such a big radius that it's 
nearly as straight as a line
<li>on the contrary, if the curvature value is close to 1, this means that the radius in that part 
of the curve is very small (the curve is extremely "incurved").
</ul>
