OP_blending_multi="Determines the method of blending the control points of the intermediate sections: Linear - no tangency constraint; Hermite - tangency will be that of the spine profile at the point where it intersects the pacement plane of each boundary profile; Smooth 1 - the endpoints of each boundary profile are interpolated with a 3D spline in relative coordinates; Smooth 2 - the endpoints of each boundary profile are interpolated with a 3D spline"
