<h4>Cross-component features (X-Components)</h4>

<p>In addition to the smart objects and the features to single objects, the <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application enables you to define features that are extended to different components. In other terms, this sort of feature (<b>X-Components</b>) modifies the different components to which it is applied. Just to have an idea of how it works, you can define a hole going through three components. Every solid included in each component is "pierced" by the hole. If the internal structure of any of the three components is modified (i.e. a new solid is added to it), at the next re-evaluation the new solid will be pierced, too.</p>

<p>You can define a feature across components by selecting the <b>X-Components</b> option when you create the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hole
<li>Linear Slot
<li>Rotational Slot</b>
</ul>

<p>Currently, you can create cross-component features made up of holes and linear slots, limitatively to the <b>Blind</b> and <b>Thru all</b> options.</p>

<p>As a general rule, this sort of feature lies in the (sub)assembly which includes the processed components and can be changed at that level only. The components involved by the feature cannot include other sub-components.</p>

<p>If you select a component existing in different copies within the assembly, the program displays a message where you are asked either to unlink that instance or continue. If you continue, all the other copies will be affected by the feature in the same way. However, you cannot select several copies of the same component when you define this feature.</p>

<p>The redefinition of a feature across components is allowed within the assembly where it was created, it is equivalent to the one of the corresponding "normal" feature and enables you to redefine the list of components involved by the feature.</p>

<p>Events generated by cross-component features follow the same rules applied to events in Smart Objects, that is they cannot be deleted, redefined, reordered, activated/deactivated, or assigned/de-assigned to variables, and you get warning messages when you try to apply these actions.</p>
