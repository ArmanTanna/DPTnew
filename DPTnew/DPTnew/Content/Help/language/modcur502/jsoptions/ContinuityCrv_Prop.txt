ContinuityCrv_Prop="Type the propagation factor for the curve to be modified: it controls the extent to which the change is distributed along the curve. It must be a value between 0 and 1. If you set 0, propagation is inhibited and the change remains local. For values greater than 0 (the maximum is 1), the higher the value the more the change extends to the rest of the curve"
