Spine_Orientation="Enables you to select the type of orientation to be applied to the resulting surface: Automatic -- if the spine is plane the local X direction of the curve is the normal to the plane, while if the spine is 3D the local X direction of the curve is such that the plane perpendicular to the plane tangent to the spine and through X is moved along a stright path; Defined with curves -- the X direction of the local system is calculated by joining points on the spine to the corresponding points on a selected curve or curve chain (which may also be the same as the drive); Intrinsic system -- the reference system is the one defined by the spine curve"
