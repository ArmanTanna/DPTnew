Plane_Associative="Enables you to control the associativity of the resulting bounded plane:<ul><li>When the box is checked, the resulting bounded plane is a <i>Skin</i>, that is an open solid retaining a link to its bounding curves, so that if you modify such curves, the surface will be modified accordingly.</li><li>When the box is cleared, the bounded plane will retain no link to its bounding curves."
