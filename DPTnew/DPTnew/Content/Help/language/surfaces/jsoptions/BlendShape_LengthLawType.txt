BlendShape_LengthLawType="Weights controlling the final shapes are computed<br>along the contours. A set of values is computed along<br>each of the two contours.<br>This drop-down list enables you to choose how the<br>tangency laws are generated from these values:<br><br>Fit -- The given contour values are smoothed<br>using the least square method.<br><br>Fixed endpoints & fit -- The contour values <br>corresponding to the parameter values of 0 and 1 will be<br>retained and kept fixed, while the least square method <br>will be applied to all the remaining contour values.<br><br>S-Shape & fit -- The contour values corresponding <br>to the parameter values of 0 and 1 will be retained and <br>kept fixed, the derivative value is set to 0, while the <br>least square method will be applied to all the remaining <br>contour values."
