FilletSurfaceSpined_Fillet_Type="Enables you to select the type of fillet to be created:<ul><li><b>Constant radius</b><br>When this type is selected, you will have to specify two groups of surfaces and a spine curve chain. The resulting fillet will have the same radius along the whole spined curve chain.</li><li><b>Variable radius</b><br>When this type is selected, in addition to the two groups of surfaces and to the spine curve chain, you will also be enabled to specify a <b>Start Radius</b> value and an <b>End Radius</b> value for the resulting fillet to vary from-to. You can also specify as many <b>Internal Points</b> as you like, where the radius value can be specified in a specific <b>Radius</b> mini-dialog box. The internal points can also be specified using the snap commands. Furthermore, it is not necessary to indicate them exactly on the spine chain: wherever you specify them, they will be projected onto it.</li><li><b>With drives</b><br>When this type is selected, no radius is to be specified - as it will automatically be determined by the construction constraints - but two drive curve chains: one on surfaces of <b>Group A</b> (<b>Drive 1 Curves</b>) and one on surfaces of <b>Group B</b> (<b>Drive 2 Curves</b>). The resulting fillet will join the two surfaces through the two drive chains, along which it will also establish tangency continuity.<br>Some notes:<ul><li>If both drive chains are selected, the fillet section will not be a circular arc but a cubic curve.</li><li>It is also possible to select only one chain of drive curves. In this case the resulting fillet will be a circular arc through the selected drive chain and be tangent along it, while on the opposite side it will just be tangent.</li></ul></ul>"
