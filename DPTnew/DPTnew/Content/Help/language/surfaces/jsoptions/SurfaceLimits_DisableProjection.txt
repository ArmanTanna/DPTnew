SurfaceLimits_DisableProjection="Enables you to control the projection of curves onto the surfaces to be trimmed.<ul><li>When the box is cleared, the limit curves are projected onto the surfaces. This option is useful when the curves do not lie on the surfaces to be trimmed.</li><li>When the box is checked, the limit curves are <i>not</i> projected onto the surfaces, which might be useful, for example, when the selected surfaces are more than one and the limits are curves lying on the said surfaces: in this case, in fact, no projection is actually needed.</li></ul>"
