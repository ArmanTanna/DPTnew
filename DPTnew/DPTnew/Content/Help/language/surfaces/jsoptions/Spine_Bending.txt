Spine_Bending="Enables you to define the blending rules at the boundary curves: Linear -- the component surfaces have positional continuity; Hermite -- the component surfaces have tangency continuity; Smooth 1 -- the endpoints of the boundaries are interpolated witha a 3D spline in relative coordinates; Smooth 2 -- the endpoints of the boundaries are interpolated witha a 3D spline so that the surfaces have curvature continuity at the boundaries "
