SurfaceLimits_ParallTolWhatsThis="One of the typical types of problems in trimming is where there are overlapping segments. In this case the program has to determine if they are really overlapping or the free-end points are just close to the other segment. One of the parameters the program uses is a test for parallelism and this tolerance is used as the limit of what the program considers to be parallel segments. Over the span of the overlapping regions, the tangents of both segments must be within the Proximity radius and the parallelism tolerance as well."
