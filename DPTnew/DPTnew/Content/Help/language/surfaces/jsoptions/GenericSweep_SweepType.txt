GenericSweep_SweepType="Enables you to choose the method to be used to sweep the contours along the drive:<br><br>Constant -- The contours will be swept along the drive keeping their orientation constant.<br><br>Constant axis --The contours will be swept along the drive while keeping an axis constant <br>through all the motion (see Direction for the axis definition);<br><br>Frenet -- The contours will be swept along each drive assuming the orientation of the <br>Frenet reference (tangent, normal, binormal) of the latter;<br><br>Enhanced Frenet -- The contours will still be swept along each drive assuming the <br>orientation of the Frenet reference of the latter as much as possible, with an <br>enhancement enabling the resulting surface to be continuous (G0);<br><br>Along one plane -- The contours will be swept along each drive assuming the orientation<br>of a selected plane, unless the Automatic plane box is checked, in which case the plane is <br>determined automaticallyas the mean plane of the drive contour.<br>It will obviously be the plane on which the drive contour lies if the latter is planar;<br><br>Surface Based -- The contours will be swept along the drive keeping an orientation based <br>on the one of the selected surfaces (during the motion, the normal will be the one of the surface, <br>while the tangent will be the one of the drive contour).<br>This method can be very useful to build lips. The Close Sweep check box shows up when <br>the initial and the final end points of the drive curves coincide. If you select it, the final <br>result will be a closed surface, while if you clear it the resulting surface will not be closed."
