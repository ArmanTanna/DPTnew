BlendShape_MatchingType="Enables you to select the method to establish the correspondence between the two contours: Curvilinear -- the point on the other contour which corresponds to a discontinuity point is the one that has the same normalized arc length; Ordered discontinuity -- active only if the two contours have the same number of discontinuity points, this option joins discontinuity points on the two contours according to their order (the first with the first, the second with the second, and so on)."
