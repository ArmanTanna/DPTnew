GenericSweep_CurveToCurve="Enables you to choose the method for joining different contours made of more than one curve each.<ul><li>When the box is checked, the sweep will be performed between <i>the curves</i> belonging to the selected groups, rather than between the groups themselves. The number of curves belonging to each different group may be different, so the number of sweep surfaces actually created will be the same as the maximum of the numbers of curves among all the groups.</li><li>When the box is cleared, the groups themselves are taken into account and the number of sweep surfaces may vary depending on the specific situations.</li></ul>"
