PartingPlane_MinFill="In some situations, in order to ensure tangency continuity, a filling surface is automatically generated in the parting plane. A filling surface is a kind of triangular patch. This box enables you to define the minimum width value for the filling surface: this dimension is the length of the external side of the triangle projected onto a plane perpendicular to the direction of ejection and measured at the width distance from the summit of the triangle"
