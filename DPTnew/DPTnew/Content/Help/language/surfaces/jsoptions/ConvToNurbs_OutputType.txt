ConvToNurbs_OutputType="Enables you to select the output type for the resulting surfaces. Standard -- To convert the selected surfaces without splitting them; Single-patch surfaces -- To convert the selected surfaces by splitting them into as many single-patch surfaces as required; Bezier surfaces -- To convert the selected surfaces by splitting them into as many Bezier surfaces as required (that is, single-patch surfaces for which the U and V parameters vary in the range [0,1])."
