PartingPlane_MinCurvRad="Enables you to define the minimum curvature value radius allowed for the parting plane. This value is very important in Numerical Control manufacturing, for example when using a rolling tool. It can be used to determine the biggest tool before gauging or undercutting. A warning is displayed when the curvature radius is smaller than this value"
