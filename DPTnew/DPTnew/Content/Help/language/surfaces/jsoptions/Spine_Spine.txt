Spine_Spine="Select the spine curves and end selection. Remember that the plane of the boundary curve must be orthogonal to the spine and the plane of the boundary curve (and of the drive curves, if any) must intersect at a point. Closed curves can be selected as spines only if they have tangency continuity"
