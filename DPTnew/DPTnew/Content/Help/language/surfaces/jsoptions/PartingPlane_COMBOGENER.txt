PartingPlane_COMBOGENER="Enables you to select which kind of generating method is used: Standard -- the parting plane is generated by moving a straight line perpendicularly to the pull direction. This mode is generally quicker, but it absorbs fewer parting line tangency discontinuities than the other two and doesn't enable you to release the target angle; Optimized -- The parting plane the same way as in the standard mode. It absorbs more parting line discontinuity than the standard method, thus resulting a bit slower; Advanced -- The parting plane is generated by an advanced method that tries to absorb the parting line tangency discontinuities (and thus is slower). This mode makes the resulting shape piecewise more NC machinable than the other ones"
