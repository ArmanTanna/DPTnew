PartingPlane_Free="When not selected, the Target angle is taken into account when computing the parting plane and a certain degree of flexibility is used when absorbing the parting line discontinuity. When the check box is selected, the Target angle value is still taken into account, but more flexibility is given in order to absorb more parting line discontinuity."
