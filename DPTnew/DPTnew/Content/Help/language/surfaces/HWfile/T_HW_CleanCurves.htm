<h3>Cleaning a curve before creating a lofted surface</h3>

<p class="notop">In the following example, some of the curves to be used in the creation of a lofted surface have invisible sharp points. Because of those points, the quality of the resulting surface might be lower than expected.</p>

<p>As you will see, as soon as a curve containing an invisible sharp point is selected, an appropriate message is displayed. By selecting the <b>Clean Curves</b> or <span class="UI_OPTION" id="SurfaceUI.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+249">Curvilinear</span> options in the <b>Parameterization</b> drop-down list under <b>More Options - Surface Type Options</b>, you can create a nicer surface. In fact the command will not use the original curve&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;which will not be changed&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;, but a local copy with no sharp points (thanks to a different parameterization).</p>

<p>Once you have started the <a href="../FWfile/T_FW_LoftedGrid.htm"><b>Grid Lofted Surface</b></a> command, you can proceed as described in the following steps (<i>please note that you can follow this step-by-step example by loading file</i>: "CleanCurves.e3").</p>

<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15"><b>1</b></td>
<td>In the <b>Select As</b> drop-down list, select the <b>Grid</b> option.<br>
<br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td width="15"><b>2<b></td>
<td>Select the curves of <b>Boundary Set A</b> as in the following illustration and end selection:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/surfaces/CLC01.gif"> <br>
<br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><b>3<b></td>
<td>As the second set of curves select the four curves as in the following illustration:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../images/CLC02.gif"><br>
<br>
The <b>Show warnings</b> button ( <img src="../../../images/general/warnings_on_new.gif"> ) shows up on top of the selection list. Click it to display the warnings. As you can see, the command detects invisible sharp points, highlighted using a marker, and an appropriate warning is displayed.<br>
Once you selected all the curves of the second set, end selection. The preview of the resulting surface is the following:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/surfaces/CLC03.gif"><br>
<br>
Using the appropriate <b>Parameterization</b> options you can get a better result: 

<ul class="noleft">
<li><span class="UI_OPTION" id="SurfaceUI.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+248">Intrinsic</span><br>


The ordinary curve parameterization. Though this type of parameterization can be used in most of the ordinary situations, you might need to use another one in order to get a smoother surface. For example, sharp points, if any, are not detected when using the intrinsic parameterization.</li>

<li><span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+238">Clean curves</span><br>


When some of the curves to be used in the creation of a lofted surface have invisible sharp points, the quality of the resulting surface might be lower than expected. As soon as a curve containing an invisible sharp point is selected, an appropriate message is displayed. By selecting this item, you can create a nicer surface. The command will not use the original curve, which will not be changed, but a local copy with no sharp points (thanks to a different parameterization).</li>

<li><span class="UI_OPTION" id="SurfaceUI.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+249">Curvilinear</span><br>


A normalized arc length parameterization type (which is: the curve parameter varies proportionally to the curve arc length, so that arcs with equal length on the curve correspond to equal variations of the curve parameter).<br>
Using this option all the input curves are internally re-parameterized based on their arc length and you will generally get surfaces with more regular isoparametric curves.<br>
Please note that if the selected curves have invisible sharp points, using this option will also result in creating nicer surfaces as in the case of the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+238">Clean curves</span> option.</li>


</ul>

<br>
Now, if you select the <b>Clean Curves</b> option, the preview changes to the following:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/surfaces/CLC04.gif"><br>
<br>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>And here are the three surfaces you can obtain by selecting the three parameterization options:<br>
</p>

<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img border="1" src="../../../images/surfaces/CLC05.gif"></td>
<td><img border="1" src="../../../images/surfaces/CLC06.gif"></td>
<td><img border="1" src="../../../images/surfaces/CLC07.gif"></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><b>Intrinsic</b></td>
<td><b>Clean Curves</b></td>
<td><b>Curvilinear</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see, by selecting <b>Clean Curves</b> or <b>Curvilinear</b> the creases of the surface displayed in the first illustration disappear and the resulting surface is nicer and smoother.</p>
