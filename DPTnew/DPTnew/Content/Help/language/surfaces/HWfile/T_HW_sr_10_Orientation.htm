<h3>Setting the Orientation of a Proportional Surface</h3>

<p class="notop">You can control the way boundary curves move along drive curves. To do this, a <i>local reference system</i> is attributed to the drive. The local system is initially calculated at the first endpoint of the drive curve and then moved along it. The way the local system is moved along the drive curve depends on the option selected in the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="SurfaceUI.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+16">Orientation</span> drop-down list (under 
<span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCOMMAND_LABEL_+5">More Options</span>: see <a href="T_HW_Lofted_Proportional.htm"><b>Creating a lofted surface starting from four curves (Proportional)</b></a>).<br>

<td>The local reference system and the boundary curve are simply translated along the drive curve: the boundary curve remains parallel to its initial position, although positioned along the drive curve. In this case, therefore, the boundary curve does not follow local variations in the drive curve, such as bends or twists.<br>

<td class="noteme" bordercolor="#ffffe1"><b>Which option to choose</b><br>
In most cases, when the drive curve is plane, the best results are obtained when the local reference system is oriented according to the drive curve (<span class="UI_OPTION" id="SurfaceUI.msg+_SURFACE_UI_LABEL_+27">Curve based</span> option). This orientation can also be used if the drive curve is not plane but, if the latter has marked twists in it, it is much better to set the orientation according to the Work Plane. In these cases, the best way to proceed is to set the Work Plane in such a way that it is as "parallel" as possible to the drive curve. To accomplish this, set the "midplane" through the curve as the Work Plane. In other words: select the

<td>When the drive curve lies on a surface, the local reference system may be oriented according to the surface in such a way that the unit vector of its Y axis is parallel to the normal to the surface at every point on the drive curve. If you choose the surface-based option but the drive curve does not actually lie on the surface, the program projects it onto the surface. If, for any reason, the drive curve cannot be projected completely onto the surface, a message is displayed.<br>
