Hatch_HatchChoice="Enables you to select the region definition method:By boundary -- the regions are defined by selecting the boundary curves and any islands enclosed within that boundary (in which case the hatch will be related to the selected boundaries by an associativity link: if you modify the boundary curves, the hatch will be modified consequently) ; By internal point -- the regions are defined by clicking within the boundary, in which case the program automatically identifies the boundary and any enclosed islands and no associativity link will be established."
