CHM2LOption="Enables you to specify the entry sequence: Angle & distance -- Chamfers between a pair of lines based on the angle formed between the chamfer line and the first line, and the distance from the intersection of the two lines measured back along the first line to the point where the chamfer begins (the depth of the chamfer). This is the default method; 2 Distances -- chamfers between a pair of lines based on two distances, the distances from the intersection of the two lines measured back along each line to the point where the chamfer line intersects each line"
