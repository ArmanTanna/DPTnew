<h1>Markups and Design workflow</h1>

<p>Markups are great tools for a collaborative design workflow. The goal is to provide feedback data (metadata) on the design document that will make the knowledge transfer easier between the participating teams. Different members of a design team can exchange, debate, and incorporate ideas faster and easier. Communicating the requests, notices and queries in the form of markups will clear ambiguity and result in a streamlined workflow. By using markups the design reviewer can easily convey what words and a static picture cannot always describe. This is where the markups can boost the design workflow.</p>

<p>Some of the salient features of the markups, in a <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application based design workflow could be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transfer of only the relevant (feedback) information (as a small file), hence avoiding large file transfers <SPAN id="TWOD">(that also includes the model data)</SPAN></li>

<li>Faster communication of design intent to other design professionals/peers</li>

<li>Improved communication of design intent between non-design professionals/management</li>

<li>Reduced review times and faster review incorporations</li>

<li>Collaborative design workflow</li>
</ul>

<table border="1" bordercolor="navy" bgcolor="#FFFFE1" cellpadding="10%">
<tr>
<td class="noteme" bordercolor="#ffffe1"><b>Note</b> <br>
The imported markups make sense only if they are opened along with the <SPAN id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing (on which these markups are based on) in the <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> applications. Only then the markups will find the actual position to attach them on the <SPAN id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing. It is also important that the original <SPAN id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing on which the *.mkp file is based on, should remain unchanged.</td>

<h3><a name="workflow">Markup Workflow</a></h3>

<p>A specific workflow should be followed for creating and using the markups.</p>

<ol class="noleft">
<li>The <SPAN id="TWOD">model (*.e3) or </SPAN>drawing (*.e2) file is made available for review.</li>

<li>The review process starts with inserting the markup in the <SPAN id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing file by using the <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="MenuBar_Document_Insert.msg+MenuBar_Document_Insert+1329">Insert</span><img src="../../images/general/litarr.gif">
<span class="UI_COMMAND" id="MenuBar_Document_Insert_Markup.msg+MenuBar_Document_Insert_Markup+1">Markup</span> commands. Once the markups are inserted, they get listed as <a href="mk:@MSITStore:vb.chm::/language/visualbookmarks/OVfile/T_OV_visualbookmarks.htm">
<span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_SYMBREFSUI_PROMPT_+53">Visual Bookmarks</span></a>.</li>


<li>Now the markups have to exported into a *.mkp file using the <a href="../HWfile/T_HW_markup.htm#export"><span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_VBOOKMARK_UI_LABEL_+7">Export</span></a> command. The same command is also used to export visual bookmarks to the *.vbk files, hence the correct output file format should be selected during this process.</li>


<li>The *.mkp file is sent back to the designer who is suppose to incorporate the review suggestions. Note that there is no need to send back the parent <SPAN id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing file on which the markups were created (if the designer already has it).</li>

<li>The designer opens the parent <SPAN id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing file that was initially sent for the review. The markups are now imported into it by importing the *.mkp file using the <a href="../HWfile/T_HW_markup.htm#import"><span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_VBOOKMARK_UI_LABEL_+71">Import Visual Bookmark/Markup</span></a> command. The same command is also used to import visual bookmarks; hence the correct file format should be selected during this process.</li>


<li>The markups are now superimposed over the existing <SPAN id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing and convey the reviewer's intent to the designer.</li>
</ol>
