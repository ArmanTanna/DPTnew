A friendly set of <i>e-Tutorial documents</i> on Visual Bookmarks has been created and is available on the Customer Care Corporate site (<a href="http://dpt3.dptcorporate.com/elearning" target="_new"><font color="#63a9d8"><b>e-Learning</b></font></a> home page). Take a look at the list of the available educational documents on Visual Bookmarks here: <a href="../../tocpages/EL_VB.htm"><font color="#63a9d8"><b>e-Learning</b></font>: <b>Visual Bookmarks</b></a>.<br> Enjoy your lessons!</td></tr></table><br>

<h3><a name="#VB_1"></a>Basic concepts</h3>

<p class="littop">In the left pane, you the following tabs:</p>

<ul>
<li><span id="TWOD">Model/</SPAN>Drawing Structure&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;showing the hierarchical structure
<span id="TWOD">, according to which environment you are in (model/drawing)</SPAN></li>


<li>Visual Bookmarks&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;listing the user's bookmarks</li>

<span id="TWOD"><li>Annotations&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;listing the annotations associated to the model (only for models)</li></SPAN>


<li>Shared Groups&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;listing of shared groups <span id="TWOD">(only for drawings)</SPAN></li>

<li id="HIDELI">Render Data&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp; listing the rendering tools that can be used to generate the required rendering effect (only for models)</li>
<li>Layers&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;listing the available layers and their associated properties</li>
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Visual Bookmarks provide a fast and simple way to save and restore the general state of a document by managing its visual appearance<span id="TWOD">, the feature activation status and the presence or absence of Spreadsheet variables</SPAN>.</p>


<p>When you create a Visual Bookmark, you specify which sets of parameters must be captured, among a wide range including the view data<span id="TWOD">, the render mode, the active layers, the work plane position,the clipping plane status</SPAN>, the visualization status of entities
<span id="TWOD">, annotations, and components and the presence or absence of features and Spreadsheet variables</SPAN> etc. All these data are stored into the Visual Bookmark and saved along with the document. You can recall an existing Visual Bookmark any time, so all the parameters it contains are restored and you bring the document back to the status at the time the Visual Bookmark was created.</p>


<p>Some typical applications of Visual Bookmarks are:</p>

<ul>
<li>with 2D drawings</li>

<li>in design review process</li>

<span id="TWOD"><li>with assemblies</li></SPAN>


<li>with drawing views</li>

<span id="TWOD"><li>together with annotations</li></SPAN>


<span id="TWOD"><li>with Sheet Metal parts</li></SPAN>


<li>in trying different configurations/snapshots</li>

<li>....</li>
</ul>

<span id="TWOD"><p>Just to have an idea on how you can effectively use Visual Bookmarks, when reviewing a design, you can create, export and import Visual Bookmarks that help identify design issues in a model being reviewed, in assemblies you can create several Visual Bookmarks bringing an assembly to different <i>working situations</i>, while in a Sheet Metal part you may wish to view it at different steps of the manufacturing process, that is keeping some specific features inactive or active. You can create also a special category of Visual bookmarks that capture only the exploded view of the assembly components. There is no limitation of the number of exploded views that you can capture depicting different sub-assemblies/working situations etc. You can later use these Visual bookmarks to directly generate 2D exploded views in the drawing environment.</p>


<p>Suppose, for example, you are working with an assembly, within your company, and a colleague of yours is working on the same assembly, but on another sub-assembly. You may wish to view just the components involved in the sub-assembly you are working on and define/keep some working parameters enabling you not to interfere with other parts of the same assembly, such as using light representations for those components that are not being worked on. Similarly, the colleague working on another sub-assembly may wish to define/keep some different parameters linked to the same document (viewing just the sub-assembly with its own components in detail, hiding or viewing not in detail not involved parts, working in wireframe mode rather than rendering mode, keep some features not active and so on) for your same operative reasons. Therefore, every person working on the same object can proceed with different operative working parameters, in order to dramatically streamline his/her job. Similarly, you may wish to transfer a model, with some specific Visual Bookmarks associated to it, to a colleague of yours that has now to handle it, in order to make his/her job easier.</p></SPAN>

<p>You can use the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_VBOOKMARK_TOOLTIP_+2">Reverse</span> command to simplify the 
<span id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing to work only on a part of it. For example, you might create a Visual Bookmark hiding all entities but the ones you are interested in. Afterwards, when you need to edit such entities, you can apply the Visual Bookmark, modify the 
<span id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing and use the 

<span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_VBOOKMARK_TOOLTIP_+2">Reverse</span> command to restore the 
<span id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing back to the configuration in which all entities are displayed.</p>



<h3><a name="#VB_2"></a>Key points</h3>

<br class="littop">
 

<ul>
<li>Visual Bookmarks are only snapshots of the <span id="TWOD">model's/</SPAN>drawing's general status
<span id="TWOD">, since they enable you to control different viewing parameters, the visualization status of entities, annotations and components and the presence or absence of features and Spreadsheet variables</SPAN>.<br>

They can be restored, and override the current status of the <span id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing.</li>


<li>Restoring a Visual Bookmark doesn't affect the data structure and the geometry of the <span id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing.</li>


<li>The parameters included in a Visual Bookmark are selected by the user when the Visual Bookmark is created.<br>
The parameters that were not included are not affected by the Visual Bookmark restoration.</li>

<span id="TWOD"><li>A specific option enables end-users to specify if a Visual Bookmark for the assembly affects only its top level or all its levels or propagates to all the lower nesting levels (in 2D environment).</li></SPAN>


<li>Visual Bookmarks are saved along with the <span id="TWOD">model/</SPAN>drawing and you can import and export the single bookmark as well as the whole Category, collecting different bookmarks.</li>


<li>You cannot have two Visual Bookmarks with the same name, even though they belong to different categories. Please note that the Visual Bookmark name check is case sensitive (that is, for example: ABC is different from abc). Thus Visual Bookmark names with the same letters and different cases will be considered different.</li>
