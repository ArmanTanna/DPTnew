OP_View_name_visibility="When selected, the name of the next view is displayed within the new view when you insert it into the drawing. (Note that this text is created as part of the view/group. If you need to move the text, you must first set the view as writable and then use the Move/Copy command. Also note that you can change the visibility of the name of an existing view by changing the properties of that view from the Main tab of the View Properties dialog box.)"
