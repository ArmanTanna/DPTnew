<h3>Importance of selection points in the Entities mode of Trim/Extend Curves with Limits</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom:3px;">In the <a href="../FWfile/T_FW_ed_TrimLimit.htm"><span class="UI_COMMAND" id="MenuBar_Document_Edit.msg+MenuBar_Document_Edit+1229">Trim/Extend Curves with Limits</span></a> command, when the 
<span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_SK_UI_CMD_LABEL_+3">Boundaries</span> mode is set to 
<span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_EDITCMD_LABEL_+5">Entities</span>, in case of multiple intersections between the boundaries and the curve to be modified, the results you will obtain depend on the positions at which you click to select them:</p>


<ul class="noleft" style="margin-top:3px;">
<li>The actual intersection point that will be taken into account is the one closest to the selection point of the boundary.</li>

<li>The selection point of the curve defines the part of it that will be retained (that is: <i>not</i> removed or extended).</li>
</ul>

<p>See the following example, where you have two intersections between the boundary and the curve to trim:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/rn_2006T2/EC_TWL_01.gif"><br>
<br>
First you select the boundary curve, close to the intersection on the left:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/rn_2006T2/EC_TWL_02.gif"><br>
<br>
Then you select the curve, as displayed in the illustration:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/rn_2006T2/EC_TWL_03.gif"><br>
<br>
The part of the curve that will be retained is the one identified by the selection point of the curve itself, while the intersection point actually used by the command is the one close to the selection point of the boundary. The part of the curve beyond that point will be removed.<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/rn_2006T2/EC_TWL_04.gif"><br>
<br>
 In the following example you can see the same behavior in the case of extension.<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/rn_2006T2/EC_TWL2_01.gif"><br>
<br>
First you select the boundary curve, close to the intersection with the lower end point of the curve to modify:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/rn_2006T2/EC_TWL2_02.gif"><br>
<br>
Then you select the curve, as displayed in the illustration:<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="../../../images/rn_2006T2/EC_TWL2_04.gif"><br>
<br>
The part of the curve that will remain unchanged is the one identified by the selection point of the curve itself, while the intersection point actually used by the command is the one close to the selection point of the boundary. The part of the curve beyond that point will be extended.<br>
