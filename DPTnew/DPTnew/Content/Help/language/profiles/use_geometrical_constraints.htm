<h3>Use geometrical constraints rather than dimensional constraints when possible to constrain your model easier and faster</h3>

<p>When you create your geometry from within the profile environment, the 2D entities, many times, form the relationships you desire to constrain as they are constructed.</p>

<p>Geometrical constraints applied after initial constructions are still faster to apply and are often more meaningful to the overall design goals than dimensional constraints. See <a href="../sketcher/OVfile/T_OV_sk_00_05.htm"><b>Geometrical and dimensional constraints</b></a> for further details.</p>

<p>An application of this idea would be: if two lines must be perpendicular, then use a
<a  href="../sketcher/FWfile/T_FW_sk_07.htm"><b>Perpendicular Constraint</b></a>. Do not use a dimension constraint (90&ordm; between two lines). On the other hand, if you want control over that angle for potential changes, "down the road", then use a <b>Fixed Angle Constraint</b> (see 
<a  href="../sketcher/FWfile/T_FW_sk_06.htm"><b>Orientation Constraint</b></a>).  Another condition would be if two endpoints should be coincident. Use a 
<a  href="../sketcher/FWfile/T_FW_sk_08.htm"><b>Coincident Constraint</b></a> instead of a dimension (zero value).</p> 

<p>Another example could be to constrain a circle to the center of a rectangle. Constructing the center point with reference lines along with a <a  href="../sketcher/FWfile/T_FW_sk_33.htm"><b>Point on Curve Constraint</b></a> allows easy control over the position of the circle.</p> 

<p>In the following example a <b>Point on Curve Constraint</b> has been used for both the reference lines and the opposite vertex.</p>

<p>To do the same task with dimensional constraints would require the use of the <a href="mk:@MSITStore:help.chm::/language/tools/FWfile/T_FW_to_02.htm"><b>Spreadsheet</b></a> command and a series of dependant variables - which, while not best in this situation, is not wrong and would work.</p>

You cannot add constraints to <b>Mid Point</b> entities, even though you can snap to <a href="mk:@MSITStore:selsna.chm::/language/snap/FWfile/T_FW_to_04_15.htm"><b>Mid Point</b></a>. <br>However, this method is very useful in many different situations.
