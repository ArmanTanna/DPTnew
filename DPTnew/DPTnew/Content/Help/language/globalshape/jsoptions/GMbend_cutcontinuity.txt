GMbend_cutcontinuity="Enables you to choose the continuity conditions between surfaces along the cutting lines of the NURBS surfaces: Positional - the surfaces along the cutting line will have positional continuity; Tangency - the surfaces along the cutting line will have tangency continuity; Curvature - the surfaces along the cutting line will have curvature continuity"
