<h3>Constraints along the first cutting line</h3>

<p>Constraints that can be set along the first cutting line are the following. Please note that the applied constraints are propagated along the object up to the first cutting line (illustrations refer to the model contained in file "bend_constraints.e3"; the line of bend is the red one, while the cutting lines are vertical lines through the endpoints of the line of bend):</p>

<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="90"><b>Status</b></td>
<td>Enables you to control the movement of the section along the first cutting line. Select an option in the drop-down list:
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><b>Fixed</b></td>
<td>No movement is allowed, whatever the other constraints are.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><b>Rotation</b></td>
<td>Rotates the section about the first cutting line.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="90"><b>Continuity</b></td>
<td>Enables you to define the continuity constraint along the first cutting line. Select an option in the drop-down list:
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><b>Position</b></td>
<td>Applies positional continuity between the two sections along the cutting line.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><b>Tangency</b></td>
<td>Applies tangency continuity between the two sections along the cutting line.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><b>Curvature</b></td>
<td>Applies curvature continuity between the two sections along the cutting line.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><b>G3</b></td>
<td>Applies continuity one degree higher than curvature between the two sections along the cutting line.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><b>G4</b></td>
<td>Applies continuity two degrees higher than curvature between the two sections along the cutting line.</td>
