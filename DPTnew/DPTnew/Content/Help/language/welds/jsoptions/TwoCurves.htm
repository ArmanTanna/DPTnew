<p>Select two intersecting curves. The welding origin is the point of intersection between the two curves.<br>
When the selection is complete, a mini-dialog appears that enables you to set the welding dimension according to the mode selected in the <span class="UI_COMMAND" id="TDWelding.msg+_TDWelding_LABEL_+83">Dimensioning mode</span> option.</p>

<!--  <p>Depending on the current welding type, you may be required to select two intersecting curves; in this case the welding origin is the point of intersection between the two curves.<br>
With other welding types, the curves do not need to intersect; in this case the welding origin is in the first point you select.<br>
When the selection is complete, a mini-dialog appears that enables you to set the welding width.</p> -->
