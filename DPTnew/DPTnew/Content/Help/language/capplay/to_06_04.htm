The term "CPBag" is used to denote the distributable for a capture. The CPBag, like a "bag", is a collection of files that are needed for the playback of the capture at a target machine. The main file is the *.cp3 file, which in turn requires the other elements in the "bag". So the bag has a folder structure, where at the root of the folder, you find the *.cp3 file and then sub folders such as <b>ReferenceFiles</b>, <b>RelatedFiles</b> and so on. The name of the CPBag folder is same as that of the *.cp3 file.</td>

These files are generated in the newly created Capture and Playback package subfolder, named PreviewFiles.

<p id="HIDEP"><b>Context Tags and the Context Tag File</b><br>
<br>
A <i>context tag</i> is an identifier of the context which you are working in; context tags can be very useful to develop quality assurance procedures and future statistics.<br>
For example, if you select the <b>New Document</b> command, the context tag is the following:<br>
<br>
<b><font face="courier">"New Document"</font></b><br>
<br>
If, after selecting <b>New Document</b> you choose <b>Model</b>, you'll have the following context tag:<br>
<br>
<b><font face="courier">"New Document""Model"</font></b><br>
<br>
as the <b>Model</b> command is a <i>second level</i> command.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A <i>context tag file</i> is an ASCII text file you can open and read with any text editor program (for example Microsoft&reg; WordPad). A context tag (a file with a ".ctx" extension created in a directory having the same name as the log file) is automatically generated whenever you perform a Capture session.</p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>For example, to build the solid on the right you had to: 

<ol>
<li>Open a new model document</li>

<li>Create a rectangle</li>

<li>Sweep the rectangle to build the box on the right</li>

<li>Move the Work Plane onto the front face of the box</li>

<li>Create a circle on the front face of the box</li>

<li>Sweep the circle to build the cylinder.</li>

<p>The <b>[Head]</b> section contains information about the hardware and software environment and customer data fields you can fill in if you need to send a Capture &amp; Playback package to your Support Center.<br>
<br>
The <b>[Summary]</b> section contains all the context tags that were used during the session, ordered by their occurrence number (<b>No.</b>) and with the additional <b>Weight</b> information that will be useful to the Support Center.<br>
<br>
The <b>[Details]</b> section contains a list of all the context tags in the same order they were used during the session, preceded by the line number of the log file they were saved to.<br>
<br>
When the <b>Create user actions file</b> check box in the <b>Playback Options</b> area is selected, another context tag file is generated when the Playback session is performed (a file with a ".ctr" extension created in a directory having the same name as the log file). The ".ctr" file has exactly the same structure as the ".ctx". A comparison between the ".ctx" and the ".ctr" files can be useful when debugging error situations.</p>
