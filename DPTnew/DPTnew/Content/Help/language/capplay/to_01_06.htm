<h2>Capture</h2>

<p>The capture environment enables you to record a session in a log file and save it in a specified location in your local machine. The two Capture commands (highlighted in the image below) enable you to record to a log file all the actions performed during the application's working session, until you select the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="idd_capplay.msg+idd_capplay+6">Stop</span> <img src="../../images/capplay/tob05_06.gif" alt="" border="0" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;button (read <a href="to_06_doc.htm#CPGUI">Overview of the Capture &amp; Playback interface</a>).</p>

<p><b><a name="Behavior"></a>Behavior of commands used to load documents</b><br>
<br>
Commands used to load documents (such as <b>Open</b><span id="TWOD">, <b>Insert from File</b> or <b>X-Ref Component</b></span> <span id="HIDETD">or <b>Insert from File</b></span>) are stored to the log file during the recording session and will then be performed in the Playback session whether the original pathnames of files exist or not. In fact, when recording, the program creates an auxiliary folder with the same name as the current log file and in its same directory. Within this folder, a RelatedFiles folder is created, containing a copy of any file opened in the recording session using the mentioned commands. An index file ("index.txt") is also created, in order to keep relations between the original and the copied files.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A <i>context tag file</i> (a file with a ".ctx" extension created in a directory having&nbsp;the same name as the log file) is automatically generated containing all the <a name="context_tag"></a>context tags used during a <b>Capture</b> session.</p>

 <span id="TWOD">
<table border="1" bordercolor="navy" bgcolor="#ffffe1">

<p><b>Context Tags and the Context Tag File</b><br>
<br>
A <i>context tag</i> is an identifier of the context which you are working in; context tags can be very useful to develop quality assurance procedures and future statistics.<br>
For example, if you select the <b>New Document</b> command, the context tag is the following:<br>
<br>
<b><font face="courier">"New Document"</font></b><br>
<br>
 If, after selecting <b>New Document</b> you choose <b>Model,</b> <b>Drawing,</b> you'll have the following context tag:<br>
<br>
<b><font face="courier">"New Document""Model"</font><font face="courier">"New Document""Drawing"</font></b><br>
<br>
as the <b>Model</b><b>Drawing</b> command is a <i>second level</i> command.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 A <i>context tag file</i> is an ASCII text file you can open and read with any text editor program (for example Microsoft&reg; WordPad). A context tag (a file with a ".ctx" extension created in a directory having&nbsp;the same name as the log file) is automatically generated whenever you perform a Capture session.</p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>For example, to build the solid on the right you had to: 

<ol>
<li>Open a new model document</li>

<li>Create a rectangle</li>

<li>Sweep the rectangle to build the box on the right</li>

<li>Move the Work Plane onto the front face of the box</li>

<li>Create a circle on the front face of the box</li>

<li>Sweep the circle to build the cylinder.</li>
</ol>

<p>and this is the context file you will automatically get if you capture the whole session:</p>

The <b>[Head]</b> section contains information about the hardware and software environment and customer data fields you can fill in if you need to send a Capture &amp; Playback package to your Support Center.<br>
<br>
The <b>[Summary]</b> section contains all the context tags that were used during the session, ordered by their occurrence number (<b>No.</b>) and with the additional <b>Weight</b> information that will be useful to the Support Center.<br>
<br>
The <b>[Details]</b> section contains a list of all the context tags in the same order they were used during the session, preceded by the line number of the log file they were saved to.<br>
<br>
When the <b>Create context tag file</b> check box in the <b>Playback options</b> area is selected, another context tag file is generated when the Playback session is performed (a file with a ".ctr" extension created in a directory having the same name as the log file). The ".ctr" file has exactly the same structure as the ".ctx". A comparison between the ".ctx" and the ".ctr" files can be useful when debugging error situations.</td>
