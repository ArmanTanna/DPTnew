<h1><a name="top">Recovering Files on Internal Errors</a></h1>

<p>In order to prevent your work from accidentally spoiling and to enable you to save anything you have done during a session, an automatic saving mechanism is available (<i>see</i> the <a href="mk:@MSITStore:forcus.chm::/language/options/IDPP_SET_GENERAL.htm"><b>AutoSave</b></a> area in the <b>General</b> category of the <b>System Options</b>): if you have not saved your changes by the time a specified time period has elapsed, the program automatically saves the current models in each active window.<br>
<br>
A situation in which you might need to save your work, if you have not done so yet, is when an Internal Error should occur.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Though this document will show you how to recover files from Internal Errors, please be aware that any file recovered after an Internal Error has occurred, whatever the way you recovered it, is potentially unsafe: you can use it at your own risk.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Be aware there is a possibility that using such files can cause unexpected damage to your work.</b> </td>

<br>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#ffffe1" bgcolor="#ffffe1">
<tr>
<td bordercolor="white">
<p>Internal errors may have several causes, but the most frequent are of the following two types:</p>

<ul class="noleft">
<li><b>Internal errors due to corrupted data</b><br>
When you load a file which contains corrupted data, you will probably get some "Internal error" messages even if you are performing very simple operations. <b>The only thing to do is <i>not</i> to create, use, or "propagate" files containing corrupted data.</b> There are some risky situations which make the probability to create and or use corrupted files grow. Files saved after an "Internal error" occurred may contain corrupted data. Great caution is to be used while dealing with these files.<br>
Files created loading different format files (IGES, VDA, STEP, DWG and DXF created with other CAD systems) may sometimes contain corrupted data. After any translation from a format different from the one of the product, you would better check the imported entities.<br>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Internal errors due to the hardware resources</b><br>
The application needs proper RAM quantities to handle big models. Memory shortage or wrong memory release operations by the Operating System may generate "Internal error" messages with no apparent reason, even if the file contains no corrupted data. The RAM quantity must be at least twice the file dimension you have to handle. Both for the RAM quantity and the graphics card, it is recommended to adhere to the suggested "<a href="mk:@MSITStore:tdein.chm::/language/tdein/SystemRequirements.htm#Minimum">Minimum System Requirements</a>".<br>
<br>
 Please note that in all the situations in which the application may require large amounts of memory&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;for instance when working with large assemblies&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;you can exploit Microsoft&reg; Windows additional memory addressing capabilities to highly improve your performance and dramatically reduce the probability of error as described in "<a href="mk:@MSITStore:tdein.chm::/language/tdein/System_enhancements.htm">Large Memory Support</a>".<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size: smaller;"><b>Low Memory Warning Management</b><br>
Furthermore, please note that you can set up the application so as to properly warn you when it is risking to run out of memory.<br>
To activate low memory warnings, open the I/O window and type in the following:<br>
<b>ekpar EP_VM_CHECK 1</b><br>
To deactivate low memory warnings, instead, type in the following:<br>
<b>ekpar EP_VM_CHECK 0</b><br>
Finally, take into account you can define the threshold memory value in MB below which warnings will be issued if they are enabled by typing in:<br>
<b>EP_VM_MBLIMIT</b> <i>Threshold_Value_In_MB</i><br>
where:<br>
<i>Threshold_Value_In_MB</i> is the value in MB below which warning messages will be displayed. Default is 100 MB.<br>
When the warning are activated, whenever the threshold value is going to be exceeded, a message similar to the following will be displayed:<br>
</div>

<tt style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 11px;">This application may run out of memory.<br>
Total memory: 2047 MB.<br>
Free memory: 100 MB.</tt></li>

<td>In order to avoid data losses and corruption and to incrementally save the changes you make to documents, a very simple method is to <a href="mk:@MSITStore:help.chm::/language/file/FWfile/T_FW_fi_06.htm">save</a> your models/drawings to different files during a work session.<br>
<br>
For example, you might save your "sample" document first to "sample_01" and then to "sample_02", "sample_03", and so on. If a crash or an Internal Error occurs, even in the case the recovery files automatically generated by the program should be corrupted, you wouldn't have lost all of your work, but only the last changes you made after you last saved.</td>
