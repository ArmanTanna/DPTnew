GDIMension_Type="Enables you to specify the Type of the dimension to be created, based on the selection you performed: Length -- Enables you to measure the dimension of a linear entity; Point & Line -- Enables you to measure a linear dimension between a particular point and a linear entity; Half View -- Enables you to measure a linear dimesion, indicating twice the distance; Angular -- Enables you to measure an angular dimension indicating the angle between the linear entity and the X-axis, the Y-axis, or an axis projected at a user-specified angle; Parallel -- Enables you to measure distance between two linear entities, parallel to each other; Angular chain -- Enables you to measure a series of angular dimensions drawn end-to-end ; Angular parallel -- Enables you to measure a set of angular dimensions drawn from a reference axis. When an arc or circle is selected, you are enabled to dimension the entity depending on the selection you make from the drop-down list: Radius -- Enables you to insert radius dimension; Diameter - Enables you to insert diameter dimension; Arc length -- Enables you to insert arc length dimension."
