<h3>Log File of the ThinkDesign to 3MF Conversion</h3>

<p>When <a href="3mf_02.htm">saving a 3MF file</a>, a log file of the conversion is created in the same directory as the 3MF file with the same name and the ".log" extension.</p>

<h4>The log file structure</h4>

<li><b>Export information</b>&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;The remainder of the log file lists information regarding the actual export into the 3MF file.</li>
