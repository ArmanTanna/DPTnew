PlaneIntersect_Choice="Enables you to choose the input type that best matches your needs:<br><br>Planar surface/planar surface<br>Enables you to determine the intersection between two selected planar<br>surfaces (for example: two faces of solids). In this case only the actual<br>intersection will be detected and created. Virtual intersections will not<br>be taken into account.<br><br>Planar surface/plane<br>Enables you to determine the intersection between two selected planar<br>surfaces, the first of which will be considered as it is and not extended,<br>while the second one will be considered as an infinite plane so as to<br>detect not only its actual intersections but also the virtual ones.<br>The definition method for the plane can be chosen in the Plane drop-down<br>list.<br><br>Plane/plane<br>Enables you to determine the intersection between two planar surfaces<br>— which will be considered as infinite planes, so as to take into account<br>also their virtual intersections — you can define as described above."
