<h2>Restore Selection modality for selections and settings in curve <span id="TWOD">and surface</span> commands</h2>

<p>For most curve <span id="TWOD">and surface</span> commands, if you interrupt the command session your selections and settings are not lost: they are "<i>frozen</i>" in order to enable you to use them again without having to repeat them all, which might take a long time, at least in complex situations. The <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+184">Restore Selection</span> button ( <img src="../../../images/rn_800/LastTransform.gif"> ) is displayed on top of the selection list. It enables you to restore selections and settings as described below.</p>

<ul class="noleft">
<li>When you run a command for the first time, the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+184">Restore Selection</span> button is not yet enabled and it is grayed out.<br>

As soon as you perform a selection or change the value of one of the command settings, the button will be visible and available.</li>

<li>If you quit a command using the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCOMMAND_TOOLTIP_+2">Cancel</span> option, next time you run it again: 

<ul class="noleft">
<li>If the command was quitted without performing any selection or changing any setting, the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+184">Restore Selection</span> button will still look grayed out.</li>

<li>If at least one selection had been performed or one setting had been changed, the selection/setting was stored by the command and the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+184">Restore Selection</span> button will be visible and available. When you click it, the said selections/settings will be restored.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>If you quit a command by clicking <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCOMMAND_TOOLTIP_+1">OK</span>, all the selections you performed and the settings you changed will be stored by the command. Next time you run it, the 
<span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+184">Restore Selection</span> button will be available. When you click it, all the previous selections and settings will be restored.</li>

<li>If you select the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_TDCOMMAND_TOOLTIP_+3">Apply</span> button, all the last selections you performed and the settings you changed will be updated by the command. The 
<span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+184">Restore Selection</span> button will be immediately available: if you click it, the previous selections and settings will be restored.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you click the <span class="UI_OPTION" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+184">Restore Selection</span> button and the selections/settings have been restored, the button is grayed out.</p>
