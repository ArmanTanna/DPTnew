<h4>Curves defined by fitting to points</h4>

When you add a curve by fitting it to a set of points there are two different methods you can select in the <b>From</b> drop-down list to specify the points:
<UL class="noleft">
<LI><b>Points</b>&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Specify points by directly indicating one by one all the points you want the curve to fit</LI>
<LI><b>ASCII file</b>&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Specify points by loading an ASCII file containing the coordinates of the points you want the curve to fit.</LI>
</UL>
<br>You can control the following characteristics of the curve (remember the values you enter must comply with the <a  href="../../MathConc/T_MC_cv_01.htm">fundamental relationship</a> between
control points, degree, continuity and number of arcs for a NURBS):
<UL class="noleft">
<li>The curve <b>Degree</b> and <b>Continuity</b>
<LI>If the <b>Automatic</b> option is selected in the <B>Approximation</B> drop-down list under <b>More Options</b>, you will have to specify the <b>Arc number</b> (the number of arcs that compose the curve)
<li>If the <b>Select arc joints</b> option is selected in the <b>Approximation</b> drop-down list, you will have to indicate the <b>Arc joints</b>.</LI>

<li>The <b>Parameterization</b> type. Depending on your choice, the resulting curve can have an arc-length parametrization (the sample points are spaced as equal arc-length along the curve), a uniform parameterization (the sample points are equally spaced in the domain of the curve) or an arc-length parameterization based on the chord length between the fitting points.</li>
</UL>
In addition, under <b>Advanced Options</b>, further options are available to define the tolerances used to control the sampling:
<ul class="noleft">
<li><b>Max. sampled chord error</b>&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;the maximum distance between the chord (between two adjacent sample points) and the curve.</li>
<li><b>Max. sampled torsion error</b></li>&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;the maximum angle between the normals at two adjacent sample points.
<li><b>Max. sampled arc length</b>&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;the maximum value for the length of the chord between two adjacent sample points.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Notice that the first and last points specified are in fact interpolated and become the start point and end point of the curve, respectively.
