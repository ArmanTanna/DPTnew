Fitting_Parametrization="Enables you to select the type of parameterization to use for the fitting curve(s): Refined arc length -- the sample points are spaced as equal arc-length along the curve; Current -- parameterization is obtained by taking into account the minimum among the chord error, the chord length and the torsion error; Uniform -- the sample points are equally spaced in the domain of the curve."
