Split_ExtendCurves="Enables you to decide whether to split the curve also at its virtual intersection or only at its actual intersections with boundaries. When the check box is selected, the selected curves will be split also at their virtual intersections with the boundaries (i.e: the intersection points obtained by extending the splitting curves up to the curves to be split). If a boundary does not intersect the curve, nor does its extension, the curve to be split will be extended up to its intersection with the said boundary (which means that a new curve segment will be actually created) and contemporarily split at the end point where the extension starts. When the check box is not selected, the curves will be split only at their actual intersections with the boundaries."
