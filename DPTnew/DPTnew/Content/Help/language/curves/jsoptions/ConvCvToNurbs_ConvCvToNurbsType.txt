ConvCvToNurbs_ConvCvToNurbsType="Enables you to select the conversion mode: Tolerance -- enables you to set the tolerance value to be reached and the maximum number of control points. Unless you check the Specialized check box, a cubic NURBS will be created; Parameters -- enables you to set the parameters of the resulting NURBS. You can create NURBS of higher degree, but you will have to try by setting different values until you obtain the desired tolerance; Advanced -- enables you to perform the conversion by setting the continuity order both at the endpoints and at the internal points of the resulting curve This method will even enable you to force the creation of high knot continuity NURBS (internal knots with multiplicity 1. As multiplicity for a NURBS is the difference between its degree and the value of its continuity, the continuity value for NURBS with multiplicity 1 is maximum)."
