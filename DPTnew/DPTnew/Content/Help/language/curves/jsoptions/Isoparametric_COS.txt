Isoparametric_COS="Controls the type of the resulting curves. <br><br>When it is selected, the resulting curves will be<br>of the Curve on Surface type. In this case,<br>if the surface is modified, the curves will follow the change. <br><br>When it is cleared, the resulting curves will be NURBS and<br>they will not follow any surface change."
