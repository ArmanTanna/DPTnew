mc_12_OP_4="Using some keys of the keyboard, you can constrain points to move along the direction of an axis. Proceed as follows: While dragging the points ( after you've pressed the selection button of the mouse), click one of the following keys (no matter whether upper or lower case): H to constrain points to move along the horizontal direction of the screen V to constrain points to move along the vertical direction of the screen D to constrain points to move along the depth direction (the one perpendicular to the plane of the screen). The distance points will be moved along the depth axis is the same as the one you moved the mouse from the original position along the horizontal axis. If you move the mouse to right, the points will be moved in the positive depth sense (outward from the screen); if you move the mouse to the left, the points will be moved in the negative sense (inward to the screen). X to constrain points to move along the X direction of the Work Plane Y to constrain points to move along the Y direction of the Work Plane W to constrain points to move along the Z direction of the Work Plane. The cursor will be changed accordingly to the chosen constraint. To release the constraint, release the selection button of the mouse. Click another of the above listed keys to change the constraint."
