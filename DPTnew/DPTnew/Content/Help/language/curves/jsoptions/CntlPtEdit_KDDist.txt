CntlPtEdit_KDDist="Enter the value of the distribution factor which varies in the range [0,1]; the lower this value is, the more the shape will correspond to the type of distribution you selected: 1 -- applies the same movement and/or weight of all the control points within the range. If this value is set, the type of the distribution is going to be ignored.  0 -- the movement and/or weight is applied in inverse proportion to the distance from the central control point. If this value is set, the shape will fully correspond to the type of distribution you selected. "
