ConnectCrv_Reset="When the mode is set to Automatic: computes the blending curve resulting from the specified geometric continuity at each end, the tangent weights at each endpoint and the setting of the Default mode (Single arc or Minimum degree). If you had previously specified curvature weights, they will be reset to defaults and curvature weights will no longer be maintained. When the mode is set to Control points: computes the blending curve resulting from the specified geometric continuity at each endpoint and the setting of the Default mode (Single arc or Minimum degree). Hitting this button has no effect on prior control point manipulations. "
