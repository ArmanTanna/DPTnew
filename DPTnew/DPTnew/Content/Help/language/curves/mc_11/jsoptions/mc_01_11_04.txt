mc_01_11_04="Enables you to mirror selected entities about a plane of symmetry. A mirror is a transformation which corresponds a general point P to a point P' lying on a perpendicular line through P on a pre-set plane known as the plane of symmetry and at a distance from this plane equal to that of P. A reflection is completely defined when the plane of symmetry is identified."
