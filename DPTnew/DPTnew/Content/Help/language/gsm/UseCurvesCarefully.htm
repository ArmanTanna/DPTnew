<h3>Use curves carefully</h3>
<p class="notop">Here are some tips on how to use curves whithin the <a  href="../globalshape/FWfile/T_FW_GMTadvanced.htm"><span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+20">Advanced GSM</span></a> command.<p></p>

<ul class="noleft">
<li>Do not use curves with discontinuities or holes
<li>Use the <a href="mk:@MSITStore:selsna.chm::/language/selection/FWfile/T_FW_ed_28.htm"><b>Chain</b></a> selection command.

</ul><br>
For example, while working with the <a  href="../globalshape/FWfile/T_FW_GMTadvanced.htm"><span class="UI_COMMAND" id="tdesign.msg+_GM_UI_LABEL_+20">Advanced GSM</span></a> command you might happen not to be able to select curves as initial and/or target curves. Nothing seems to happen and no mini-dialog appears.<br>&nbsp;

<ul class="noleft">
<li>GSM does not work with curves that have different "singularities", that's to say when one curve has a sharp corner (even if obtained as the result of applying the <a href="mk:@MSITStore:help.chm::/language/curves/FWfile/T_FW_mc_05.htm"><b>Join Curve</b></a> to different curves) and another is a single continuos curve (no sharp corners). <BR><BR><IMG border=1 SRC="images/cv01.gif"><BR><br>The two curves are an arc (green) and a curve (red) made of two joined curves at a sharp angle. Please note that joining curves (using <b>Union</b>) at a sharp angle (or non-tangent) is not a correct procedure.

<li>One possible solution is splitting (<b><a href="mk:@MSITStore:help.chm::/language/curves/FWfile/T_FW_mc_07.htm">Split</a></b>) the arc into two parts:

<BR><BR><IMG border=1 SRC="images/cv02.gif"><BR><br>so that you can select two groups of curves (line-arc, line-arc) 
<BR><BR><IMG border=1 SRC="images/cv03.gif"><BR>&nbsp;
<li>Another solution is to introduce a sharp point into the arc (modifying the arc using the <a href="mk:@MSITStore:help.chm::/language/curves/mc_01/FWfile/T_FW_mc_01.htm"><b>Control Points</b></a> command or in other ways)

<BR><BR><IMG border=1 SRC="images/cv04.gif"><BR><br>
In this case it will work because the Initial curves and the Target curves have the same number of "singularities" or "sharp points".
