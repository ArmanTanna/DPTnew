Cone_Associative="Enables you to control the result:<ul><li>When the box is checked, the resulting entity will be a parametric solid. A drive dimension will be associated with the radius of the base of the cone and another one with the cone height. Depending on the construction method, if a truncation has been set, a drive dimension will be associated with the radius of the minor base of the cone or with the vertex angle, while, if the truncation is set through the taper ratio, the latter can be redefined using the <b>Redefine Feature</b> command. The icon of a solid will be displayed in the <b>Model Structure</b>.</li><li>When the box is cleared, the final result will be the surfaces composing the shape.</li></ul> "
