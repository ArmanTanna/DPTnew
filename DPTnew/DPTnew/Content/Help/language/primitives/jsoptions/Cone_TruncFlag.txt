Cone_TruncFlag="Enables you to choose the method to be used to apply a truncation to the cone you are creating.<ul><li><b>Minor radius</b><br>To truncate the cone by specifying the value of the second base radius. A <b>Minor Radius</b> mini-dialog box is displayed. Type in an appropriate value or define it interactively by dragging the corresponding handle.</li><li><b>Vertex angle</b><br>To truncate the cone by defining its vertex angle (given the cone height, the angle formed by the axis of the cone and by its generatrix). A <b>Vertex Angle</b> mini-dialog box is displayed. Type in an appropriate value or define it interactively by dragging the corresponding handle.</li><li><b>Taper ratio</b><br>To truncate the cone by defining the tangent of the vertex angle (which is also the ratio between the difference major radius/minor radius and the height). Type the appropriate value in the <b>Taper Ratio</b> box.</ul>"
