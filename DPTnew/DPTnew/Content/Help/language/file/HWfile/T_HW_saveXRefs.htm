<h3>Saving a file including modified X-Reference Components</h3>

<p>Suppose the <i>xx</i> component:</p>
<img border=1 src="../../../images/assembly/xx.gif">

<p>Is included as X-Reference (component) in different assemblies (such as <i>xxxx</i> and <i>xx+yy</i>, that you can see in the <i>samples</i> folder):</p>
<img border=1 src="../../../images/assembly/xxx.gif"> 
<img border=1 src="../../../images/assembly/xx_yy_History_Tree.gif">

<p>You decide to modify it while working on the <i>xx+yy</i> assembly as follows:</p>

<ul class="noleft">
<li><a href="mk:@MSITStore:as.chm::/language/assembly/FWfile/T_FW_as_04.htm"><b>Set Current</b></a>.</li>

<li>Modify it (for instance, make a simple hole, as shown in <i>this</i> illustration).<br>
<p><img border=1 src="../../../images/assembly/xx_0.gif"></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Then double-click on a blank area or select the <a href="mk:@MSITStore:as.chm::/language/assembly/FWfile/T_FW_as_05.htm"><b>Top Level</b></a> command to reset the conditions of the assembly so that there is no longer a current component.</p>


<p>You are warned that some objects must be updated and you can notice that the <b>Rebuild Model</b> icon has been switched on in the meanwhile, therefore <a  href="../../history/FWfile/T_FW_ht_08.htm">rebuild</a> the model by clicking the icon.</p>

<p>Now <a  href="../FWfile/T_FW_fi_05.htm">save</a> the assembly file.</p>

<p>Because of your modifications, you get a message warning you that one or more components have been modified and you are asked to save the changes.</p>

<table border=1 bordercolor="navy" bgcolor="#FFFFE1" width="95%">
<tr>
<td class=noteme bordercolor="#ffffe1">When you modify some X-Reference component(s) and save the file, be it the whole assembly including the component(s) or just the component set as current, the <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application checks <i>all</i> the X-Reference component(s) included in the document <i>below</i> the current level. If any of them has been modified since the last saving, you are warned and you are asked to save the changes.</td></tr></table>

<p>Therefore, by choosing to save the changes in your document, the <b>think<font color="#FF0F00">3</font></b> application <i>updates</i> the component you modified in the current assembly. The changes would be propagated to all the X-Reference component sub-components, if any, within the document.</p>
<img border=1 src="../../../images/assembly/xx_yy_0.gif">

<p>Of course, by opening any other file including the <i>xx</i> component as X-Reference (component) such as the <i>xxxx</i> file, you can see it has been <i>updated</i>, according to the changes you made in the starting assembly.</p>
<img border=1 src="../../../images/assembly/xxx_0.gif"><br>
<br>

<table border=1 bordercolor="navy" bgcolor="#FFFFE1" width="95%">
<tr>
<td class=noteme bordercolor="#ffffe1"><b>Note</b><br>
When you have two open documents at the same time in your working session and they both include the same X-Reference (component), if you modify the component in one of them, then save the document, you'll need to <a href="mk:@MSITStore:as.chm::/language/assembly/FWfile/T_FW_as_07.htm">reload</a> the component in the other document, in order to view it updated.
