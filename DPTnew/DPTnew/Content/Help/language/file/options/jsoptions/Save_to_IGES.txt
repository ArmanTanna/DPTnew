Save_to_IGES="The IGES and ThinkDesign have their own set of color index, and a number is associated with each color. On selecting this check box, the ThinkDesign color number is mapped to the same color number in IGES. For example, if 28 represent red in ThinkDesign format and in IGES 28 represent blue, the red ThinkDesign entities will change from red to blue on saving the ThinkDesign file in IGES format. On clearing this check box, the colors are mapped according to the similarity of shades. Hence, the color numbers might change. Note that this check box is available only when the 'Save colors in IGES format' check box is cleared."
