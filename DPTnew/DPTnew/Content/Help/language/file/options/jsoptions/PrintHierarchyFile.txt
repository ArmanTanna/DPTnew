PrintHierarchyFile="This parameter is enabled only if the Keep hierarchy box is also selected. When selected, it enables you to create a report file (with the same name of the input file and extension '.rpt') — in the same folder of the file you are loading — containing the hierarchy information: parent-child relations, unit of measure, transformation matrix associated with each child and component name. When not selected, no report file is created (default)."
