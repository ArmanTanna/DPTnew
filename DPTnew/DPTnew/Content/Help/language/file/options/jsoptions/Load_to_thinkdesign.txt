Load_to_thinkdesign="The IGES and ThinkDesign have their own set of color index, and a number is associated with each color. On selecting this check box, the IGES color number is mapped to the same color number in ThinkDesign. For example, if 28 represent blue in IGES format and in ThinkDesign 28 represent red, the blue IGES entities will change from blue to red on loading the IGES file in ThinkDesign format. On clearing this check box, the colors are mapped according to the similarity of shades. Hence, the color numbers might change. Note that this check box is available only when the 'Load colors in IGES format' check box is cleared."
