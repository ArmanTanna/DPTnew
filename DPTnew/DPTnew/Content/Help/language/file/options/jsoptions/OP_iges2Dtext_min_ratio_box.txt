OP_iges2Dtext_min_ratio_box="IGES text strings (ent. 212) are defined by the character height number and the total length of the string, while in think3 the length of the text string depends on the Gap and Ratio parameters. Starting from the IGES text length and the number of characters, the converter calculates the Ratio value which allows the text in think3 to the same length as the source text. In some special cases, the Ratio calculated may be too small, or even a negative value. This control enables you to solve this problem by setting a minimum Ratio value."
