PolyWidth="If Omit, the polyline width, if any, is ignored. If Always as filled hatch, the polyline will be converted as lines and arcs simulating the polyline contour with a solid filled hatch filling the contour. If Optimize filled hatch when possible, the polyline conversion will be as the previos case except in the case of constant width and linetype different from continuous: in such case the contour will not be simulated and the width will be represented by using the maximum think3 width.
