SplitClosedFaces="Some of the CAD applications cannot handle revolved surfaces. To overcome this problem the revolved surface can be split into its individual component surfaces that can then be managed by the CAD application. When the check box is selected, closed surfaces and solid faces are split into their component surfaces and when not selected, they are not split."
