OptPerformance="When checked, an optimization is performed during the conversion, assuming some specific entities are contained inside each block to be converted. For this reason, optimization speeds the process up a good deal, but in some cases it might lead to results differing from the expectations. When cleared, blocks are converted to group entities with no optimization."
