ImportCorrupt="Check this option if the think3 application fails to import a DXF/DWG drawing because the latter is corrupt. Sometimes, DXF/DWG files contain incomplete data. In this case, attempting to load the corrupt file results in an error; by checking this option, the converter will attempt to recover the incomplete data of the corrupt drawing and proceed with the import."
