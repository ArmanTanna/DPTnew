ChangeComponentFileName="This parameter is enabled only if the Keep hierarchy box is also selected. It enables you to assign names to the component '.e3' files. It was added to completely manage STEP files created in systems not assigning univocal names to components and sub-components. When selected, file names are built as follows: name of the STEP file to be loaded + progressive number + component name. This is the default value. When not selected, each '.e3' file is assigned the same name as the corresponding component in the STEP file"
