Analysis_CONTINUITYTYPE="Select the type of entities the check must apply to:<br>Surface-surface<br>When you select two surfaces, you will get data about distance, curvature,<br>angles of tangents and normals.<br>Curve-surface<br>When you select a curve and a surface, you will get data about distance, tangency and curvature.<br>Point on surface - Point on surface<br>When you select a point on a surface and a point on another surface, you will get<br>data about distance, tangency and curvature.<br>In addition, handles will be available to move both the points on the respective surfaces<br>so as to enable you to analyze continuity locally.<br>Curve - curve<br>When you select two curves, you will get data about distance, tangency, curvature and torsion."
