Assign_Selector1="Enables you to select one of the following options: Dimension/Feature -- Enables you to assign the variable to a drive dimension or to a feature/datum entity. In the case of threaded holes/shafts, choosing this option will cause the variable to be assigned to the hole/shaft diameter rather than to the thread diameter or pitch; Thread Diameter -- When a threaded hole/shaft is involved, this option enables you to assign the variable to the thread diameter, rather than to the hole/shaft diameter or to the thread pitch. Thread Pitch --  When a threaded hole/shaft is involved, this option enables you to assign the variable to the thread pitch, rather than to the hole/shaft diameter or to the thread diameter."
