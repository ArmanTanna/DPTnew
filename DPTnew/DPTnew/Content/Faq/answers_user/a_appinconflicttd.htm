	    <p>think3 software applications run on an up-to-date operating system, properly configured. 
        <br>We cannot however guarantee their correct operation in the presence of any software. Here below we have reported a list of software packages that we have found to be incompatible with ThinkDesign and must, therefore, be uninstalled for guaranteeing the proper operation of the CAD package.</p>
        <ul class="myul">
          <li><b>Setpoint</b> - Distributed by Logitech for the customization of the mouse button programming. The presence of this software in automatic startup mode, prevents the initialization of ThinkDesign.
          <li><b>MediaFire Desktop</b> - The presence of this software in automatic startup mode, prevents the initialization of ThinkDesign.
          <li><b>Dell Backup &amp; Recovery</b> - Some recent versions, preinstalled on Dell computers, prevent the completion of the installation of ThinkDesign.
          <li><b>Adobe Creative Cloud</b> - It installs services in automatic startup mode that can block the initialization of ThinkDesign.
          <li><b>ownCloud</b> – The client version involves the installation of the Micorsoft Visual C++ Redistributable component, that may be incompatible with the one requested for ThinkDesign.
          <li><b>ARXivar</b> – This software may create conflicts with ThinkDesign PDF printer because it installs a similar PDF printer. Once installed it can block ThinkDesign registration during installation.
          <li><b>Dropbox</b> – Some recent versions can block ThinkDesign registration during installation or the execution of ThinkDesign. Please update Dropbox to the latest version or remove the program.
          </ul>
		<br>
        <p>If you experience any problem during the installation or startup of think3 products, make sure that none of the above listed software applications is installed on your machine. If necessary, uninstall the dubious components and find alternative software packages.</p>
