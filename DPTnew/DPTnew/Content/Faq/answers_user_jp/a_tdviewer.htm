        <ul class="myul">
        	<li>ThinkDesign bundle (no difference compared to TDEngineering, TDStyling, etc.). Consequently, it’s a large file to download and install.
            <li>To get it you just need to download ThinkDesign .exe/.iso file from the Download section of the DPT3Care website and ask the Pwd Release Service for a license of the product.
            <li>TDViewerPlus is available only to customers with an active maintenance contract of ThinkDesign products, and the license is valid until the maintenance contract expires.
			<li>Full ThinkDesign User Interface without some commands, such as the Save command.
        </ul>
		<br>
		<p><span class="hl">TDViewerLight</span>:</p>
        <ul class="myul">
        	<li>Lighter version to install, downloadable from the Download section of the DPT3Care website.
            <li>No password required.
            <li>Restricted ThinkDesign User Interface, many commands are not showed.
			<li>It could be used by anyone that needs to view a model generated by someone providing them a CAD file in .e2 or .e3 format. There is still some added value compared to a raw 3D viewer like Markup&#47;Annotation, which can remain inside the ThinkDesign world, plus some Quality Check visualization.
        </ul>
