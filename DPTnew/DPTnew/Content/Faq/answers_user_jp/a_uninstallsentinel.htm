	   <p>To uninstall Sentinel, open <strong>Command Prompt (CMD)</strong> as <strong>Administrator (Run as Administrator)</strong>.<br>
         Type <i>C:\Program Files\think3\2015.2\common\haspdinst –r</i>, then press <strong>Enter</strong>. A message is displayed informing you that the Sentinel LDK Run-time Environment has been successfully removed.<br>
		<br>
		You may have to repeat the command as many times as you have installed Sentinel.<br>
		<br>
		For this, check the System Registry. 
        Follow this path to find the <strong>InstCount Key</strong>: 
        <i>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Aladdin Knowledge Systems\HASP\Driver\Installer\</i></p>
        <br> 
        <img class="centerImage" src="../img/1.2_Sentinel issues.jpg">
        <br> 
        <p>For every <i>haspdinst –i</i> run, the <strong>InstCount Key</strong> value has been increased by one.<br>
		If you have tried to install Sentinel several times, to completely uninstall it, you must launch <i>haspdinst –i</i> until you reset this counter.<br>
        <br>
		<p>The Sentinel LDK Run-time Environment installer utilities contain an automatic mechanism that prevents more than one copy of the Run-time Environment from being installed on a single computer, even if multiple protected applications are installed on the computer. The Run-time Environment installer utilities employ a counter that keeps track of the number of protected applications installed on a given computer. For each installation after the first, the installer simply increments 
        the counter instead of actually installing an additional copy of the Run-time Environment. Similarly, the counter is decremented each time the Run-time Environment is uninstalled.<br>
        The Run-time Environment is not actually uninstalled until the last protected application is uninstalled.</p>
