    <p><span class="hl">Important Notice</span>: DPT does <span class="hl">no more</span> provide <span class="hl">dongles for permanent licenses</span>. Moreover, DPT will no more provide passwords for new licenses on dongles, but in some special cases described below.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This decision has been made possible by the fact that, since April 1st 2016, dongles are no more required for products in version 2015, not even for floating licenses.</p>
        <br>

        <br>	
         <p>As shown in the table above, only floating licenses of TD & TT in v.2014 will keep requiring an USB dongle.</p><br>
        	
         <p>Currently, also GBGDM 6 and 7 require an USB dongle.</p><br>
         
         <p>Having said that:</p>
         <ul class="myul">
         	<li><span class="hl">HUS dongles</span> will be provided only for <span class="hl">floating licenses of TD/TT2014</span> (and prior)
            <li>passwords linked to dongles will be generated <span class="hl">only for maintenance reasons</span>
			<li><span class="hl">BLK (BLACK) dongles</span> can be provided for <span class="hl">ASF/ASP licenses</span>. However, please note that they are available only starting <span class="hl">from v2018</span>.
         For customers that ‘own’ a <span class="hl">PL</span> but want to use a dongle, we can provide a <span class="hl">BLK dongle with a temporary pwd</span> (same expiration of the PL maintenance). The end-user will get back his PL when he decides not to pay PLSS, returning then the dongle.
         </ul>
         <br><p>In parallel, DPT will incentivate the return of dongles for their replacement with node-locked licenses.</p><br>
         
        <p>Please note that <span class="hl">"let's go node-locked"</span> is more a marketing decision than a technical one. In fact, DPT supports VARs in their effort to have as many customer as possible with an active maintenance or subscription contract, which is the mandatory condition to export licenses.</p><br>
        <p>Are there exceptions to this strict rule? Just a couple: </p>
         <ul class="myul">
        	<li>adoption of a floating license for TD2014 DPT has to provide mandatorily a dongle; DPT could allow it also for TD2015, in reason of its extra price in terms of both license and maintenance
            <li>adoption of an ASF license, in reason of its extra price and its limited duration.
        </ul>
