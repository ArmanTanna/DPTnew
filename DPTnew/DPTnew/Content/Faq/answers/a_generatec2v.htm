		<p><b><u>OPTION A</u></b></p>
		<p>If you installed <span class="hl">version 2015, 2016 or 2017</span>, please proceed as follows:</p>
		<p>You should run the executable file <span class="hl">DPTGetC2V.exe</span> present in the installation folders (example: <i>C:\program files\think3\thindesign 2015.2\common\utilities</i>). <br>
		A shell window will appear, showing the folder where the .c2v file has been saved (usually the 
        <span class="hl">Temp</span> folder).</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:8pt; padding-left:20px">If you do not find the generated .c2v file, just follow these steps: click 'Start', 
        select the 'Run' command. A dialog box with a search bar will appear, type '%temp%' and then click 'ok'. 
        The 'Temp' folder will open. Sort files by the last modified. 
        The first file on the list will be the .c2v file you are looking for.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p><b><u>OPTION B</u></b></p>
		<p>If you downloaded <span class="hl">ThinkDesign 2018 or successive versions</span>, during the installation, a .c2v file is automatically created on your <span class="hl">Desktop</span>. <br>
		The file is named after your machine plus a code number, for example: <b>PC-John_110137.c2v</b>.</p>
        <p>In case you don't find the file or need to re-generate it, please follow the procedure described in "OPTION A". However, instead of the "Temp" folder, the .c2v file will be located on your Desktop.<br>
		<br>
        <p>Now please send an email at <a href="mailto:pwdrelease@think3.eu">pwdrelease@dptcorporate.com</a> attaching your .c2v file or activate the license on your own through DPT3Care website.</p>
