	   	        <p>Your PC or your USB dongle is broken, or you have lost it or it got stolen? 
        You cannot use your license for one of these reasons? Do not worry: write to DPT a letter, using one of the following templates, asking to enable again the use of the license.<p>

        <br>
 		<div class="letterDiv">
         <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px; font-style:normal;">ACME LTD</p>
         <p> Dear DPT,<br><br>
		 <p style="text-indent:30px">we hereby declare that we have updated the operating system of 
         the workstation whose machine ID is XXXXXXXX. The upgrade has been done by reformatting 
         the above mentioned workstation.<br><br>
         Therefore, we kindly request to DPT to issue a new license on such workstation/on a new workstation, according to its policy and modalities. We understand that this will result in the conversion of our permanent license (PL) into an annual temporary license (ASP).<br><br>
		 We are aware that such self-certification form can be shared with those organizations that, by order of DPT, certify the presence of software applications’ licenses in the companies. 
		 <br><br>
         <p style="text-align:right; margin-right:80px">Kind regards</p><br>

        <p style="text-align:center;">or</p> 
        <br>
 		<div class="letterDiv">
         <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px; font-style:normal;">ACME LTD</p>
         <p> Dear DPT,<br><br>
		 <p style="text-indent:30px">we hereby declare that we our workstation, whose machine ID 
         was XXXXXXXX, got lost/stolen. 
         Please find in attachment the official notification of loss/theft.<br><br>
         Therefore, we kindly request to DPT to issue a new license on such workstation/on a new workstation, according to its policy and modalities. We understand that this will result in the conversion of our permanent license (PL) into an annual temporary license (ASP).<br><br>

		 <p><b>Warning 1</b>: if the license involved in the breakdown, 
         loss or theft is <span class="hl">'out of maintenance'</span>, 
         DPT has the full right NOT to provide you with
         a new license. Do not get confused by the term 
         <span class="hl">permanent license</span>: as you can read in the License Agreement 
         (<a href="../../../Faq/Index#licenseagreement" target="_parent">What about the License Agreement?</a>) a permanent license
         gives you the right to use the product <span class="hl">for an unlimited period of time exclusively</span> on the computer officially and 
         <span class="hl">originally</span> licensed by DPT.<br><br>
         By the way, what would happen if someone stole my Panda or if I crashed
         my Skoda? I'd have to <span class="hl">buy</span> a new car, in both cases.<br><br>
         You still have two options:
        <ul class="myul">
        	<li><span class="hl">come back to maintenance</span>
            <li>buy a <span class="hl">CHW</span> and then proceed with the request.
        </ul>
		<br>
		<p><b>Warning 2</b>: <span class="hl">Permanent Licenses’ recovering</span> after hardware crash or other events implicating license loss is <span class="hl">NOT available</span>. 
		Therefore, if a Permanent License gets somehow lost or becomes irrecoverable as a result of the customer's actions, DPT can provide you for free just with a <strong>substitute license related to the maintenance contract</strong> .<br>
		This "new" <strong>ASP</strong> license will be active and working only until the end of the contract and will be renewed when the maintenance contract itself is renewed.</p>
