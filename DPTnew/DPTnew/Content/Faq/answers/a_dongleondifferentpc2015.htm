        <p><span class="hl">IMPORTANT</span>: Since DPT does not manage and support USB dongles anymore, each reference to them present in this Guide has to be considered obsolete.</p>
        <br />
        <p>This is easy! Simply move the dongle to the other PC, where you have previously installed TD2015.
		You don't need to create another C2V file, since the license is linked to the dongle.</p>
