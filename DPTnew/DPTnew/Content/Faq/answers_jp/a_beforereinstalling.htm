	    <p>In case of a malfunction that suggests uninstalling and reinstalling 
        the product, you can first try to repair the installation, using 
        <span class="hl">Repair/Change</span> installation functions.</p><br>
        <p>A similar procedure is available to update the installation when it is necessary to add optional components that were not selected during the first installation.</p>

        <ol class="myol1">
        <li>Open the Control Panel and select <b>Programmes and Features</b> to access the list of the installed applications.
        <li>Scroll down the list until you find the ThinkDesign installation that you want to repair or update and select it.
        <li>R-click the mouse button to open the drop-down menu and select <b>Change</b>.
        <li>In the Wizard that opens, select one option among the following: 
            <ol class="myola">
              <li><b>Edit</b> to update the installation by choosing the add-ons.</li>
              <li><b>Repair</b> to re-run the latest installation.</li>
              <li><b>Uninstall</b> to completely remove the installation.</li>
             </ol>
		</ol>
        <br>
        <p>To run the Repair or Change functions, the file folder resulting from the first installation must be available; otherwise you will be prompted to indicate the path of the folder where to find the files.</p>
