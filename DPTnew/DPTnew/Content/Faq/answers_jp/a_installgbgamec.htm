<body> 
	    <p>If you install AMEC under Windows 7, folders and file are downloaded in a different way with respect to the old operating systems.</p>
		<p>All file and folders which were usually located under ap40 are now placed directly under the installation root folder, at the same level as dm91.</p>
		<p>From the tests run under Windows 7, we gathered:</p>
        <br>
		<ul class="myul">
           <li>Install <strong>dm91</strong> in a path with no blanks (for instance: <i>C:\think3\dm91</i>) and not under <i>C:\Program Files (x86)\think3</i>
           <li>After installing GBGDM and AMEC, re-organize files so as to match the file structure expected by AMEC procedures, that is:
		    <ol class = myola>
             <li>Create an <strong>ap40</strong> folder at the same level as <strong>dm91</strong> (<i>C:\think3\ap40</i>).
             <li>Copy all folders and  files located under C:\think3 – except dm91 – to folder ap40.
			 <li>Copy folder <strong>.\ap40\infotmm_i</strong> to <i>C:\think3</i>  and rename it <strong>infotmm</strong>
             <li>Copy files <strong>gap_pre.cnf</strong> and <strong>tmm_pre.prc</strong> from <strong>.\ap40</strong> to <strong>.\dm91</strong>.
		    </ol>	
		</ul>
		<p>After these interventions, if you start <strong>GBGDM</strong> &rarr; <strong>Tools</strong> &rarr; <strong>Applications</strong>, it should be possible to activate AMEC, having previously entered AMEC password through dm91 License Administrator.</p>
